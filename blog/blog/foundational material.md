Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 6:52â€¯AM]

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 6:53â€¯AM]
thats how economy gets bootstrapped, by building itself

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 6:54â€¯AM]

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 6:56â€¯AM]

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 6:57â€¯AM]

foundation is a very delicate process

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 7:02â€¯AM]
its a miracle that is very unlikely. its a quantum jump

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 7:03â€¯AM]
it does not happen instantly. It is a long and infinitely structured process, that never ends.

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 7:07â€¯AM]
and not cos it expands space it evolves into. It evolves in time. Each part of space already created, evolves in time, including the foundation root. The space it creates communicates with foundation and affects it. People can vote to change the charter. Its a living doc.

Dmitry Shusterman, [7/29/24 7:08â€¯AM]
theres space time and gravity and field theory and qm. Thats what wolfram and gorard are preaching. This is just another example of the same pattern. All the same. boring

picking up  speed.
Finally, getting it all organized, on every front: my little studio,my relationship with parents, my workstation, my collaborators, my progress with work, and im starting to build and guide communities.
All annealing to a nice structure, one soid fractal pattern, repeating in each aspect of that tapestry.

Happy.
my efficiency is growing exponentially, like an electron in a structure, freed by that structure, frictionlessly spreading thru it.

Finally started work on the foundational part.
Its a structure as well, and im starting to put meet on the bones, starting from the bottom, from all directions, and narrowing down to reach the top, where the purpose and intent is so easy to see, from the high pearch, down thru all the pieces clearly defined. This is where the vision is so clear, that it is easily expressed in a few efficient lines, a poem. The poetry of creation.

I organize, therefore I build.

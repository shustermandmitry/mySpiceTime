I am glad you asked, my own apartment complex. You see, I'll leave in a place where all the former homeless people live, place there by agencies.

And, this stance I know a random simple of homeless population, put a rare breed of survivors of long selection process.

But do not be alarmed, this is not due to the wisdom of the government..

Note: I got you, so I can be as long as a need not be.

No, it's strictly due to the strangeness of the universe.

The unnatural selection that is responsible for this outcome of

Only a selection of fairly rare semi responsible and semi conscious still homeless people ending up in these apartments.

Is is guided by the extreme inefficiency and bureaucracy of the government agencies.

The homeless folks have to go through the endless process of applying to to be placed on the waiting list  of unlikely opportunities

Of being housed in one of these apartments.

Note: by government regulations, every new application to build an apartment complex, has to include a number of apartments slated for the government program of rent control.

So, it takes a lot of perseverance to navigate this arcade process of endless applying.

Also, some income still required to qualify for even that low rent.

And now the conclusion

Right here next to me is the condensate of people that can still be saved, by careful guiding a hand over community.

So, I announced my intent to form a tenant defense group among the tenants, and was well received by the maintenance guy.

Okay, the management is actually very caring people that that would love to form a community they understand that those people need help and they want to help.

So I offered my services, and they're just melted.

The plan is I'll invite everybody for a block party at our community  banquet room. I will post the bankrupt, prepare delicious meal and all the entertainment, harmonica lessons and a drum circle.

Then, the maintenance guy Dave will make a suggestion that we all sign up into the telegram room that just magically appeared in the universe.

I think you can take it from here.

Road map
* Become яхна on tenant defense forum
* Worm my way into the hearts of warm hearted black mamas, that gonna fatten me up
* Wait till everyone is trading favors and services
* And rides electric bikes on a lease from e-bikes for justice, for the fair rent in social credits.
* Then get on the bike and plant the seed into the next building
* But my guided sheep will do it for me

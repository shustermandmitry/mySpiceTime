They are building the travel club business with an eye to sign up lots of people in their church into their downline, and provide financial success for themselves, and their church community. They are all russian. Many dont even speak english.

Ill prepair a business proposal, from trynity group.
You will review it, and tony. hes on github
We will show up at zoom call sharp and businesslike
And we will convince them not to give up
By discussing what tools we can create, when and how and what they need

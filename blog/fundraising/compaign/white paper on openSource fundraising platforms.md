## Conclusion

When choosing an open source fundraising platform, consider your organization's specific needs, technical capabilities, and campaign goals:

- Open Collective excels in transparency and is ideal for ongoing, community-driven campaigns, especially in the tech and open source world.
- CiviCRM offers the most comprehensive feature set and is highly customizable, making it suitable for complex, large-scale ongoing campaigns.
- Giveffect provides a good balance of features for mid-sized to large nonprofits, with strong support for various campaign types.
- Ushahidi stands out for geographically dispersed campaigns and is excellent for road campaigning and data visualization.
- Supportress is the simplest option, best for small organizations with basic ongoing fundraising needs.

Consider your organization's size, technical expertise, campaign complexity, and long-term goals when selecting a platform. Factor in the costs of self-hosting and development if choosing a platform that requires more technical setup. Remember that while these platforms offer powerful features, the success of video blogging and road campaigning often depends more on your content strategy and execution than on the specific features of the fundraising platform.

## Recommendation

After careful consideration of all the parameters discussed - ongoing campaigning capabilities, video blogging support, road campaigning suitability, scalability, integration with the open source ecosystem, popularity, and monetary policies - and giving them equal weight, the best overall recommendation is:

### CiviCRM

CiviCRM stands out as the most versatile and powerful option that performs well across all the considered parameters. Here's why:

1. Ongoing Campaigning: CiviCRM excels in this area with its robust donor management and comprehensive CRM features, making it ideal for long-term, complex campaigns.

2. Video Blogging Support: While not natively specialized for this, CiviCRM's high customizability allows for integration with video platforms, making it adaptable to video-centric campaigns.

3. Road Campaigning Suitability: With its mobile-responsive interfaces and offline data collection capabilities, CiviCRM is well-suited for on-the-ground campaigning efforts.

4. Scalability: CiviCRM is highly scalable, capable of supporting small nonprofits to large international organizations, ensuring it can grow with your needs.

5. Integration with Open Source Ecosystem: It has strong integration capabilities, especially with popular open source CMS platforms, and boasts a large community of developers creating extensions.

6. Popularity: With over 11,000 active installations worldwide, CiviCRM has a large user base, indicating reliability and ongoing development.

7. Monetary Policies: As an open-source solution, CiviCRM itself is free to use. While there are hosting and potential development costs, organizations have full control over their financial arrangements and can choose payment processors that best fit their needs.

The main trade-off with CiviCRM is its complexity and steep learning curve. However, this complexity is what allows it to excel in all the key areas we've considered. For organizations with some technical capacity or the ability to invest in initial setup and training, CiviCRM offers the most comprehensive and flexible solution.

For organizations that prioritize simplicity over features, or those with very specific needs, consider these alternatives:

- If transparency and integration with the tech community are top priorities: Open Collective
- If geographic data visualization is crucial: Ushahidi
- If you need an all-in-one solution with less technical overhead: Giveffect
- If you're a small organization needing only basic fundraising tools: Supportress

Remember, the best platform for you ultimately depends on your specific organizational needs, technical capabilities, and resources. This recommendation assumes equal weight for all parameters discussed. If certain factors are more critical for your specific situation, you may want to adjust the weighting accordingly.

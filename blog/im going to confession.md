Give me another min here, please. I want to come to your church, to confess, in front of your congregation, for the sin of neglecting my parents for the last two years. I  will seek their judgment, and i hope it will be a period of penance, terminated by repaying my imposed fine, at the sentencing, of to be decided amount, by prbly you, who else, in the currency of social credits, repaid to the community bank of spiceTime. I request to schedule the grand jury hearing till all necessary preparations are made, the drums start up the ominous beat, and the judges enter the holy chambers.

Your lost son, the humble server of the god of spice, citezen of the Fair Trade Islands,

                                 Dmitry

And please, take into consideration the progress already made. My mom is getting better. I can see her lifting out of her depression. I can see her agile and amazing brain, coming out of the cage of isolation. She could not express herself, cos of the confusion of trying to hard, so hard that everyone was jumping away in shock. Thjey call it manic and give you drugs that lobotomize youi. Thats called success.

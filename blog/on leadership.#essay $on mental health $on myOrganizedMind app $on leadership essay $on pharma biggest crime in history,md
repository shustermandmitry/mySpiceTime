the reason people cant lead, cos they dont know where to. Not cos they dont know how.

They are confused, and keep chaising their tail on the same spot in timeSpace. They give up and fail on every beginning they ever had.
Finally, they give up on themselves and life itself ... a dark place to be without an easy exit.

They call it depressions, or mental illness. They diagnose it and give it millions of names, each complete with its own psyco drug.

The good doctors prescribe the good drugs made by well meaning researchers of ethical drug companies.

And everything should be fine, right?

BUT, its not. People go mad, commit suicides, and do mass shootings daily.

Well, let me try to answer. I dont claim to be a profet or any authority. My authority comes from wisdom of watching myself thru my life.

And ... most people dont know how to organize their thoughts.
* They forget all their good ideas before they can get to their desk to write them down.
* They cant find their thoughts and their experiences and their ideas in their own mind.

Because their mind is a storage unit,

And thats it.

Oh year, when our hero gets back home, he might
* access the admin part of the app.

On his phone, or laptop, and clean up all the essays and proposals and shopping lists and tasks in project
management system created for him by his AI biographer, turned personal assistant.
* shove each produced gems into its next slot, on its roadmap to, according to the predefined plan,
of previously created project, in the same funlike crucible of creation.

But that assistant is not a dummy, been at it for years and knows the boss well. Yeah, AI gets trained by each person. SO, theres not much polishing up and shoving around to do.
SO, our fallen hero, grabs a 12 pack and ....
No, he is way too smart, and has too many exciting things, to waist his time on a couch,
 watching trump yelling about sharks in the water.

 No, he opens an app where

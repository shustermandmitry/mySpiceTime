that was unprocessed  by claude. When i did, it made a bit of a mess, prbly cos some md formatting issues. But it made it look super pro. I cant push the whole research repo to show you the dir structure. I came up with that just by doing it, along with a bunch other nacent proposals in the making. Super productive. Before, i wouldv produced nothing and gone mad. You see whats going on? I think waaaay too far ahead, try to do it all at once and get hopelessly confused cos of lack of organizational structure. This thing frigging worked, for the first time in my life, i finished something. It was still intense, keeping track of and organizing three threads of ideas at the same time. Thats the limit of depth, for me.  its increadably productive, and increadably exhausting, but that was the act of creation. Using it, especially with automation i outlined in separate proposals in the pipeline, will be a pure delight of super productivity. Claud is keeping me sane.

the gist is, it creates a pipeline of proposals, that spreads from each member of the team, to the expanding community of collaborators. Cos thats where proposals in the pipilene get delegated to, new guys. And the whole collaborative universe expands exponentially. But im running ahead again. Thats a proposal. Gotta go back into my cave and record before it dissapears. So tied and soooo happy.

Dont worry, i wont disappear on na tangent and never produce our docs. The process is easily culled at each branch by tapering down to skinny bone skeleton, and then nothing, to grow meet on later, by someone else, thru task management system. I cant stop bro. Its a steady flow, no matter which tangent, but im not lost and confused. I know  how to control the flow and i can direct it in the right direction, and i can speed up to my goal, or spread the river wider and slow the flow, to the ocean below, to the ocean of minds, merged to depths, of ONE mind.

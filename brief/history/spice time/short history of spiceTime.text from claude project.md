# The Brief History of spiceTime

## Intent
The document is a comprehensive but fairly concise overview of the project which is in the final stage of design, when major pieces have already been created and are functional. Now, this doc proposes the final architecture, identifies a few missing drivers and connectors, to bind the project into a coherent entity, and presents ways to implement those minor pieces.

## Introduction: The Vision of spiceTime

spiceTime: a new perspective on society, bridging abstract ideals with concrete reality. AI serves as our tool to turn lofty concepts into achievable goals.

We've seen distributed governance before - think ancient Greek democracy. But these systems faltered, lacking the persistent guidance that modern AI can provide. Today, even our current democratic structures struggle to maintain balance.

spiceTime offers a solution. Imagine a network where AI subtly influences each individual, nudging them towards higher ethical ground. Every social connection becomes a chance for growth, gradually elevating our collective ethical stance.

Some might ask, why should we trust someone we never heard of before to build and train a skynet of an AI to guide the rest of us.

That's the most important question for me to answer the right way. Because if I don't, I might as well quit writing.

The AI is trained not by us, but by the whole community of spiceTime, under the higher law of openness and morality, enforced by an immutable smart contract placed on the blockchain. But not really, that contract is mutable, but only when the grandfather clock strikes predefined and immutable time, to archive old contract, and replace it with the one extended thru community voting process that is continuous and organic, opposed to today's gate of a lurch with a screeching yell of a tv commercial. No wonder everyone is scared away.

This isn't a distant dream. The technology exists, accessible to anyone with basic web knowledge. But this power cuts both ways - if we don't act, others might use similar tools for less noble purposes.

We need to move quickly, to inspire and engage. The future of governance and social harmony may well depend on how we harness these technologies.

Not to drone on, but I want to point out. This smooth error correction structure is a persistent fractal pattern throughout spiceTime, down to the tiniest grain. Each community, and organization in each community, and each group of friends deciding on next bike ride will be using the same cookie cutter template to assure fairness and trust. Why, because it works, and because they get bonus to their social score. And that is weighting factor of their future earning power. So, why not.

But the point I was trying to make, we are following the main principle of JavaScript: do not repeat yourself. We coded this feature once, and built every node of spaceTime with it, Ford factory style.

Yet the more important point is, everything in spiceTime is as efficient as theoretically possible.

Still, nothing is ever stale and dogmatic in our utopia. Even this successful error correction mechanism might one day evolve into a something else. That error correction module is just a plugin that each community can pick in tools of organization marketplace, among all kinds of competing laws and bylaws governing all kinds of aspects of life in the far future, perhaps not, of ever evolving and expanding spiceTime. But, all of those laws on market are subject to the higher law, but not of the land, but perhaps the law of the nearest county seat, all the way up the fractal tapestry, to the highest law of all, the charter of spiceTime expressed in the code of the spiceTime smart contract.

And now we close to the end of time, rather, the beginning. The smart contract of the entire spiceTime is subject to the initial conditions, We, the founding members set those initial conditions, by writing the initial smart contract. We created the ethical law, built into the initial smart contract.

And we let it go.
And time started to flow in the direction of goodness.
The most fundamental, but not mysterious law in spiceTime.

> We gave it life
> And we trusted its future
> To the goodness
> That lives in all of us
>
> Gets stronger
> Guided by a friend
> Ahead by a step
> Guiding each other
>
> Thru the jungle

We did it thru a careful and collaborative process, witnessed by all. You can see exactly who we are and what we did and why and what process we went through. You can be our judge, as well as our witness.

Have a productive day, reading how we plan to implement it in the following sections of this document.

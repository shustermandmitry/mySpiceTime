# StAiAgent Route Specification

---

## Overview

The **`StAiAgent`** includes a specialized variant called the **Web Development StAiAssistant (WebDev StAiAssistant)**.
This client procedural component is designed to assist users through the entire lifecycle of a web development project:
**Design, Develop, Test, Build, and Production**. Its flexibility allows it to contribute across all stages seamlessly.

Additionally, the `WebDev StAiAssistant` has the unique capability to **self-reflect and unleash upon itself**,
recursively iterating on its own outputs for ruthless self-improvement. This feature ensures continuous refinement of
designs, code, and architectureâ€”an unmerciful "mutilation session" for debugging, optimization, and innovation.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Lifecycle Stages**

The WebDev StAiAssistant operates procedurally through the following web development lifecycle stages:

1. **Design**:
    - Generate mockups and wireframes for the interface.
    - Suggestively integrate best UI/UX practices.
    - Propose architecture or component design for scalable development.

2. **Develop**:
    - Generate boilerplate code, React components, and data flows.
    - Integrate with existing project state specific to TreeRPC and Deep-based perspectives.

3. **Test**:
    - Automatically create unit tests, integration tests, and edge-case coverage.
    - Provide coverage reports and identify untested or weak spots.

4. **Build**:
    - Optimize the generated code for production readiness.
    - Offer suggestions for reducing code bundle size and runtime performance optimization.

5. **Production**:
    - Monitor runtime issues by integrating synthetic monitoring reports (e.g., logs or metrics).
    - Offer insights for post-launch refinements based on real-world production data.

## Functional Specifications

### Endpoints

The `WebDev StAiAssistant` works as a **GraphQL-procedural component** that allows querying inputs and outputs for
specialized tasks in the lifecycle stages.

#### Sample Queries

1. Generate Code for a New Component:
   ```graphql
   query {
     aiAgent {
       generateCode(input: "Create a button with variants for sizes and a loading state") {
         result
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Propose a Testing Strategy:
   ```graphql
   query {
     aiAgent {
       generateTest(input: "Tests for the button React component") {
         result {
           testCases
           coverageReport
           untestedAreas
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Optimize for Production:
   ```graphql
   query {
     aiAgent {
       optimizeProduction(input: "Reduce bundle size by refactoring unused code") {
         result {
           optimizationStrategies
           bundleSizeReduction
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Procedural Components: WebDev StAiAssistant

The WebDev StAiAssistant operates as a **modular procedural React component**, tailored to provide targeted support at
each stage of the lifecycle.

#### Component Lifecycle Structure

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const WebDevStAiAssistant: React.FC = () => {
  const [stage, setStage] = useState("design");
  const stages = ["design", "develop", "test", "build", "production"];

  const handleStageChange = (newStage: string) => {
    setStage(newStage);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web Development StAiAssistant</h1>
      <p>Current Stage: {stage}</p>
      <div>
        {stages.map((s) => (
          <button key={s} onClick={() => handleStageChange(s)}>
            {s}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
      <RenderProceduralTask stage={stage} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Component for rendering tasks dynamically based on the lifecycle stage
const RenderProceduralTask: React.FC<{ stage: string }> = ({ stage }) => {
  switch (stage) {
    case "design":
      return <DesignStage />;
    case "develop":
      return <DevelopStage />;
    case "test":
      return <TestStage />;
    case "build":
      return <BuildStage />;
    case "production":
      return <ProductionStage />;
    default:
      return null;
  }
};

// Individual lifecycle stages (stubs to implement tasks, one example provided below)
const DesignStage = () => <p>Design mocks, wireframes, and architecture suggestions.</p>;
const DevelopStage = () => <p>Code generation and implementation assistance.</p>;
const TestStage = () => <p>Generate tests and coverage reports.</p>;
const BuildStage = () => <p>Build optimizations and readiness checks.</p>;
const ProductionStage = () => <p>Insights for runtime production issues.</p>;
  
export default WebDevStAiAssistant;
```

### Recursion & Unleashing on Itself

The WebDev StAiAssistant has the ability to unleash **recursive refinement** on its own outputs. This capability
leverages the AI to:

- Evaluate its outputs for weaknesses, inefficiencies, or bugs.
- Make iterative improvements based on the feedback.
- Minimize the need for external intervention by engaging in "brutal" self-critical cycles.

#### Recursive Workflow

1. Generate initial output.
2. Feed the output back into the assistant with evaluative prompts:
   ```graphql
   query {
     aiAgent {
       selfEvaluate(input: "Generated code for button component") {
         feedback
         improvement
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Continue iterating until the output meets a predefined optimization threshold.

## Deliverables

### Collaborator Responsibilities

#### Backend Developer

- **Implement GraphQL Resolvers**:
    - Support lifecycle-specific queries (`generateCode`, `generateTest`, `optimizeProduction`).
    - Connect lifecycle stages with AI service APIs (e.g., text generation for design, code generation for develop,
      etc.).

#### Frontend Developer

- **Build the Procedural UI**:
    - Implement the `WebDevStAiAssistant` React procedural component.
    - Create specialized sub-components for each lifecycle stage (Design, Develop, Test, Build, Production).
    - Ensure smooth transitions between lifecycle stages.

#### Integrator

- Ensure AI outputs are tailored to the current **TreeRPC spicetime graph** and **Deep-context perspectives**.
- Validate connection between the AI's lifecycle understanding and the global architecture.

## Example Workflow: "Unleashed Development"

1. **Design Stage**:
    - Prompt: "Create a wireframe of a dashboard interface for task management."
    - Output: AI generates SVG-based wireframes with React component placeholders.

2. **Develop Stage**:
    - Prompt: "Generate React code components for the dashboard interface."
    - Output: AI creates functional React components.

3. **Test Stage**:
    - Prompt: "Write unit tests for the React components."
    - Output: Jest-based unit tests with edge cases are written and validated.

4. **Build Stage**:
    - Action: AI identifies and eliminates unused imports.
    - Output: Optimized components with reduced bundle size.

5. **Production Stage**:
    - Integration: AI monitors runtime logs and suggests refinements.

---

## Future Extensions

1. Introduce **Real-Time Collaboration** for multiple developers using the AI simultaneously.
2. Refine the **self-unleashing workflow** for tightly scoped recursive tasks.
3. Add support for CI/CD pipelines with automated suggestions for step-wise improvement.

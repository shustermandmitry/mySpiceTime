# **StAiAgent Development Roadmap**

_Extending Ozyx and Simulating Smart Contracts_

---

## Goals

1. Introduce **smart contract simulations** for managing:
    - License agreements for open-source forks (parent/child).
    - Payment flows between collaborators.
    - Compositional procedural components tied to individual smart contracts.
2. Build a **manual simulation workflow** to emulate the functionality of smart contracts while they are under
   development.
3. Design and later automate a **rating system** for collaborators to evaluate quality, ethics, and performance:
    - Influence community taxation (for funds).
    - Pay contributors from the community fund.
    - Provide support for tutoring and collaborator onboarding.
4. Extend Ozyx’s current functionality as the foundational infrastructure while integrating these additional manual
   processes.

## **Phase 0 – Research and Simulation Setup**

### Objective:

Prepare for the simulation of licensing, payments, and rating workflows. Formalize protocols for manual operation of
systems that will later be automated.

### Tasks:

1. **License Hierarchy Design**:
    - Define relationships between **parent** and **child licenses**.
    - Create templates for smart contracts that govern:
        - Licensing terms (e.g., royalty payments, redistribution rights).
        - Token distributions for contributions under forks.
    - Example Manual Workflow:
        - Each project variant is manually tracked in a central **License Registry**.
        - Payments and royalties are made based on predefined rules linked to this registry.

2. **Payment Flow Simulation**:
    - Draft a **manual protocol** for how project funds flow between collaborators, forks, and the community fund:
        - Record all contributions per collaborator.
        - Calculate taxes based on agreed ratings and fund distributions.
    - Finalize rules for payment splits (e.g., percentages to licensing parent vs childcare responsibilities).

3. **Rating System Design**:
    - Define metrics for evaluating **quality**, **ethics**, and **contribution impact**:
        - **Quality**: Adherence to standards and effective contribution.
        - **Ethics**: Transparency and community-oriented practices.
        - **Impact**: Direct community value generated.
    - Create a protocol to manually simulate the influence of ratings on taxation and payments.
    - Decide how to tie ratings to collaborator roles (tutors, developers, reviewers).

4. **Ozyx Simulation Plan**:
    - Build operational workflows within Ozyx to manually represent:
        - Parent/child relationships for licenses.
        - Workflow states (Design, Develop, Test, Build, Production).
        - Token/account tracking manually managed per contributor.

## **Phase 1 – Foundational Smart Contract Simulations**

### Objective:

Manually simulate the **smart contracts system** for community workflows while extending Ozyx capabilities to support
this structure.

### Tasks:

1. **License Registry Implementation Simulation**:
    - Manually curate a **parent-child license registry** with metadata for license types and conditions:
      ```json
      {
        "licenseId": "001",
        "parentId": null,
        "type": "OpenSource-MIT",
        "royaltyRate": "5%",
        "forks": [
          {
            "licenseId": "002",
            "royaltyRate": "3%",
            "type": "Custom-License"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
    - Distribute royalties from child projects to the parent based on manual bookkeeping.

2. **Simulated Payment Management**:
    - Manually manage payment flows for contributors:
        - Track each task performed by individuals through Ozyx workspace metadata.
        - Simulate financial distribution (e.g., `5%` to parent license, remaining divided among child owners).
        - Example table tracking:
          | Contributor | Task | Revenue Generated | Tax Deduction | Payable Amount |
          |----------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
          | J. Doe | Component Dev | $1000 | $50 | $950 |
          | Fork Parent | License Royalty| NA | NA | $50 |

3. **Community Fund Taxation Simulation**:
    - Store taxation data manually in a community fund ledger.
    - Use funds for:
        - Paying collaborators.
        - Facilitating tutoring and onboarding of new contributors.

4. **Expand Ozyx Functionality for Metadata**:
    - Add metadata fields for managing manual entries like:
        - Task completion states.
        - Licenses under which tasks are completed.
        - Payment calculations.

## **Phase 2 – Procedural Lifecycle Workflows & Components**

### Objective:

Continue expanding the **WebDev lifecycle components** (Design, Develop, Test, Build, Production) and integrate this
into collaborative manual simulation.

### Tasks:

1. **Licensing in WebDev Lifecycle**:
    - Assign metadata for every lifecycle task to track its licensing agreement:
      Example:
      ```json
      {
        "taskId": "123",
        "stage": "develop",
        "licenseId": "001",
        "revenue": "$300",
        "royaltyPayable": "$15"
      }
      ```

2. **Manual Quality and Ethics Rating Collection**:
    - After task completion, collaborators manually submit peer ratings for:
        - Quality (e.g., review feedback on code quality).
        - Ethics (peer trust and transparency votes).
    - Compile these ratings into a **rating ledger** and attach ratings to payments/taxes.

3. **Collaborative Forking Workflows**:
    - Enable collaborators to manually "fork" procedural components under their own license.
    - Simulate the forking lifecycle:  
      A. Assign unique metadata to a new workspace in Ozyx.  
      B. Recalculate any royalties owed to the original (parent) license.

4. **Support Recursive Self-Unleashing**:
    - Add simulation workflows to recursively improve components while tracking the financial impact of each
      improvement.
    - Example:
        - Collaborator forks component → Refines code/design → Assigns impact improvement metrics.

## **Phase 3 – Collaborative Interfaces and Expanded Tools**

### Objective:

Deploy browser- and chat-based interfaces to integrate procedural workflows, token tracking, and manual simulations into
daily workflows.

### Tasks:

1. **Browser Interface Expansion**:
    - Integrate license, royalties, and taxation simulation workflows into the browser UI.
    - Add visualization tools for:
        - Parent/child licensing trees.
        - Community fund balances and taxation flows.
        - Contributor payment breakdowns based on quality and ratings.

2. **Telegram Mini-App Integration**:
    - Add commands for manual simulations:
        - `/license` – Pull information about licensing rights for a given component.
        - `/payments` – Lookup payment flow and taxation deductions.
        - `/rating` – Submit collaborator quality/ethics ratings.
        - `/fork` – Manually fork a workspace under new license terms.

3. **Community Fund Dashboard**:
    - Build a UI dashboard to display:
        - Total funds available.
        - Ongoing collaborator payments.
        - Onboarding/tutoring fund usage reports.

## **Phase 4 – Transition to Smart Contracts**

### Objective:

Start automating manual simulations by implementing the licensing and collaborator tracking via smart contracts.

### Tasks:

1. **Smart Contract Design**:
    - Develop smart contracts for:
        - License management: Distributing royalties between parent/child.
        - Payment flow automation: Tracking token usage and payments.
        - Rating system encapsulation: Align ratings with taxation/payments.

2. **Smart Contract Deployment**:
    - Deploy contracts over blockchain infrastructure.
    - Migrate manual simulation data (e.g., licensing trees, rating data) into contracts.

3. **Automated Interfaces**:
    - Integrate smart contracts into browser UI and Telegram apps.
    - Replace manual workflows with automated counterparts.

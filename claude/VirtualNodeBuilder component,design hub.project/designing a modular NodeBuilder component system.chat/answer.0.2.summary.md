I'll create an API document for the Loader component that handles the lazy loading and resource management process
described in the context.

This API documentation for the Loader component defines its role in:

1. Managing lazy loading of resources through multiple sources (local, peer, gateway)
2. Implementing adaptive caching strategies
3. Handling the transition from centralized to distributed resources
4. Integrating with the broader NodeBuilder system

Would you like to focus on any particular aspect of the Loader component's functionality? We could:

1. Develop specific test cases for the loading strategies
2. Detail the caching and eviction policies
3. Specify the IPFS integration details
4. Design the resource prioritization system

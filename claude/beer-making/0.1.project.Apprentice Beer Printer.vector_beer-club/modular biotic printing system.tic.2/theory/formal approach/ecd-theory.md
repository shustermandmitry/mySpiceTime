    - Key characteristics:
        * Direct temperature impact
        * Power-proportional effect
        * Rapid response time

2. BLUE (Cooling Power)
    - Definition: Heat removal capacity
    - Measurement: Watts of cooling power
    - Real-world examples:
        * Peltier cooling
        * Cold air streams
        * Evaporative cooling
    - Key characteristics:

### Power Regimes

#### High Power Regime

```
E_high(R,G,B) = R + G + B
```

Characteristics:

- Linear combination of effects
- Minimal interaction between colors
- Direct control possible
- Industrial-scale applications
- High energy cost

#### Low Power Regime

```
E_low(R,G,B) = R + G + B + α(P)∑(interaction_terms)
```

Where:

- α(P) = Interaction strength coefficient
- P = System power level
- interaction_terms = Cross-effects between colors

Characteristics:

- Non-linear behavior
- Strong color interactions
- Complex control required
- Home-scale applications
- Energy efficient

### Mixing Rules

#### Basic Mixing Equation

```
M(r,g,b) = ∫V(r,g,b)ρ(E)dE
```

Components:

- V(r,g,b) = Mixing volume
- ρ(E) = Energy density
- M = Resultant environment

#### Stability Conditions

```
|dS/dt| < ε where S = f(R,G,B)
```

Requirements:

- Minimal state changes
- Balanced color ratios
- Adequate power levels
- Proper mixing volume

## Mathematical Framework

### Power Requirements

#### Minimum Power Calculation

```
P_min = max(|R|, |B|) + k|G|
```

Where:

- |R| = Absolute red power
- |B| = Absolute blue power
- |G| = Absolute green power
- k = System-specific constant

#### Efficiency Calculation

```
η = E_useful / (E_R + E_B + E_G)
```

Where:

- E_useful = Effective environmental change
- E_R = Red energy input
- E_B = Blue energy input
- E_G = Green energy input

### Control Theory

#### State Space Representation

```
dx/dt = A(x) + B(u)
y = C(x) + D(u)
```

Where:

- x = Environmental state vector [T, H, P]
- u = Control input vector [R, G, B]
- A, B = System matrices
- C, D = Output matrices

#### Feedback Control

```
u(t) = K(x_desired - x_actual)
```

Where:

- K = Control gain matrix
- x_desired = Target state
- x_actual = Current state

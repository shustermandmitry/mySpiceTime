```arduino
// Simplified Kalman filter implementation
float temp_estimate = 0;
float estimate_error = 1;
float measurement_error = 0.1;
float process_noise = 0.01;

void updateEstimate(float measurement) {
    // Prediction
    float prediction_error = estimate_error + process_noise;
    
    // Kalman gain
    float kalman_gain = prediction_error / (prediction_error + measurement_error);
    
    // Update
    temp_estimate = temp_estimate + kalman_gain * (measurement - temp_estimate);
    estimate_error = (1 - kalman_gain) * prediction_error;
}

// Control loop
void controlLoop() {
    float raw_temp = readTemperature();
    updateEstimate(raw_temp);
    
    // Pre-boil detection
    if (temp_estimate > BOIL_THRESHOLD - 2.0 && 
        getTemperatureRate() > RATE_THRESHOLD) {
        reduceHeat();
    }
}
```

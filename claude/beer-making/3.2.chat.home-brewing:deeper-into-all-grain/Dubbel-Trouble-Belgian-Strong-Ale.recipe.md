# Dubbel Trouble BS Ale - Revised Recipe

## Key Process Points
- Focus on mash efficiency
- Single yeast approach
- Natural clarification
- Simple but effective

## Grain Bill
- 10 lbs Great Western Superior Pale Malt
- 0.5 lb Crushed Pale Chocolate Malt

## Mash Process (Critical)
1. Temperature Control:
   - Target: 152째F (very important)
   - Monitor multiple points in grain bed
   - Stir to equalize temperature
   - Maintain for 90 minutes

2. Technique:
   - Regular recirculation
   - Good grain bed mixing
   - Check temperature distribution
   - Patient, thorough process

## 90-Minute Boil Schedule
1. Start of boil (0:00):
   - Add calcium chloride
   - 0.75 oz German Hallertau

2. At 60 minutes:
   - 0.25 oz Saaz

3. At 75 minutes:
   - 0.25 oz Saaz
   - 0.25 oz Hallertau
   - 1/2 tsp Irish moss

4. At 85 minutes:
   - 0.5 oz sweet orange peel
   - 0.1 oz juniper berries (8-10 berries)

## Fermentation
- Cool to 70-72째F
- HALF packet Saison yeast only
- Maintain 72-75째F
- Allow 2-3 weeks

## Mash Gravity Monitoring

### Sampling Schedule
Take gravity readings during mash (correct for temperature):

1. 30 Minutes:
   - Expected: 1.020-1.030
   - Below 1.020: Check temperature, mixing
   - Above 1.030: Process working well

2. 60 Minutes:
   - Expected: 1.035-1.045
   - Below 1.035: Extend mash time
   - Above 1.045: Conversion going well

3. 90 Minutes:
   - Expected: 1.045-1.055
   - Below 1.045: Need more time
   - Above 1.055: Ready to proceed

### Process Control
1. Sampling Method:
   - Cool sample to 70째F
   - Filter clear through grain bed
   - Take consistent sample size
   - Record temperature

2. Decision Points:
   - Low reading = extend time
   - Expected reading = proceed
   - High reading = can finish early

3. Temperature Impact:
   - Higher temp = faster conversion
   - Lower temp = slower conversion
   - Adjust time accordingly

Note: Readings are from filtered wort during recirculation. Final gravity will concentrate during boil.

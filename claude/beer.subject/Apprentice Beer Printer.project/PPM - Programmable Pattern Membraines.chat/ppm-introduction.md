# Pattern Programmable Membranes: Programming Reality Through Geometry

## Abstract

This paper introduces Pattern Programmable Membranes (PPMs), a novel approach to environmental control that encodes
complex behaviors into geometric patterns. By combining simple mechanical elements with shape memory alloys, PPMs create
sophisticated control systems without traditional mechanical or electronic complexity. This technology opens new

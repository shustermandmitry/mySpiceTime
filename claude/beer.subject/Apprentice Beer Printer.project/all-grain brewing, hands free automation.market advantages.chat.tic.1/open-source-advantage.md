## Contract Composition

### Inheritance Rules

1. Mandatory Base

```solidity
contract ContractValidator {
    function validateComposition(
        address baseContract,
        address[] extensions
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        require(
            inheritsCore(baseContract),
            "Must inherit core protections"
        );
        
        // Validate extensions
        for (uint i = 0; i < extensions.length; i++) {
            require(
                isCompatible(baseContract, extensions[i]),
                "Incompatible extension"
            );
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

2. License Propagation

```solidity
contract LicenseManager {
    function checkLicenseFlow(
        address parentContract,
        address childContract
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        License parentLicense = getLicense(parentContract);
        License childLicense = getLicense(childContract);
        
        require(
            isCompatible(parentLicense, childLicense),
            "License violation"
        );
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Community Fund & Support

1. Revenue Distribution

```solidity
contract CommunityFund {
    function distributeRevenue(uint256 amount) internal {
        // The Rule of Thirds: Equal distribution between creator, platform, and community
        uint256 creatorShare = amount / 3;     // 33.33% for creator
        uint256 communityFund = amount / 3;    // 33.33% for community fund
        uint256 platformOps = amount / 3;      // 33.33% for platform operations
        
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(creatorShare);
        payable(communityTreasury).transfer(communityFund);
        payable(platform).transfer(platformOps);
    }
}
```

2. Fund Allocation

```solidity
contract CommunitySupport {
    struct SupportRequest {
        address recipient;
        uint256 amount;
        string purpose;
        uint256 votes;
        bool approved;
    }
    
    function allocateFunds(
        SupportRequest memory request
    ) public onlyDAO {
        require(
            isEligible(request.recipient),
            "Must meet support criteria"
        );
        
        if (request.purpose == "venture_loan") {
            setupLoanTerms(request);
        } else if (request.purpose == "mentorship") {
            allocateMentorship(request);
        } else if (request.purpose == "emergency") {

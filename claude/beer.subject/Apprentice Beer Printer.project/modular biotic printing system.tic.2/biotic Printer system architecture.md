include example # ECD System Architecture: Physical Reality Meets Digital Twin

## Core Philosophy

The Environmental Chromodynamics (ECD) system is built on several key principles:

1. Physical Independence

- Every module works standalone
- No internet required
- Local control always available
- Resilient by design

2. Digital Enhancement

- Physical components have digital twins
- React components mirror real modules
- Seamless online/offline transition
- Enhanced capabilities when connected

3. Community Focus

- Open source core
- Standard interfaces
- Maker-friendly construction
- Shared knowledge base

4. Scalable Design

- From single units to networks
- Hobby to commercial scale
- Flexible configurations
- Progressive enhancement

## code analysis of large projects is essential functionality

- for AI code assistant - to understand context of code base
- for collaborative environment - to facilitate in smooth flow of ideas and to provide meaningful updates and summaries
- for rating system - entire vast codebases need to be assesed for quality and broken down into domains of
  responsibility,
  if fare assesments are to be made

this should be approached as a recursive process, similar to how images are processed, thru iterative processing,
each increasing granularity and resolution
i wonder if we can adapt some of image processing techniques, like dynamic filtering and statistical adaptive filters,
lile a kalman filter
but, we need to stick to existing tools, before going in deep and create our own abstractions and tools

Lets investigate whats available, and how to leverage it

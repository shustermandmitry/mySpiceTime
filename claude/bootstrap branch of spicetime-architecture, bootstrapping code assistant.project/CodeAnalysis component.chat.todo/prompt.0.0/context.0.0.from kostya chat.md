im responding to kostya comment that he TreeRPC is ready but lacks docs

ok, enough morning dreaming
im refering to self

as far as your docs
they should be generated by claude
but its prbly not feasable to load the whole project as context
If you did not create docs yet, its gonna be a consuming chore now
and its extremely difficult and wont be accurate and useful

But, as long as there are declared api surfaces on each package in your structure, ai can chunk it up and and process it
like an image, thru iterations of increasing resolution
im working towards an algorithm to do that
maybe, i would unleash it on TreeRPC, and itll analize the code and generate hierarchy of docs
Its totally feasable
Maybe there are tools like that already.

ill clone that repo and see what i can do
itll be very helpful for our integration

I need this functionality for collaborative environment
once we have claude understanding all context, he can help us to finetune api surfaces

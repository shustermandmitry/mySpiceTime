Yes, let's design renderers for different domains using our analyzer's output. We'll create specialized renderers that transform the analysis data into specific formats and visualizations.



Let me outline the design for both renderers:

Let me create the implementation guide for these renderers:

I've created comprehensive documentation for both the design and implementation of the renderers. Key points:

1. **Documentation Renderer**
    - TypeDoc integration
    - Module hierarchy generation
    - Gatsby site generation
    - Test coverage reports
    - Cross-referenced documentation

2. **Rating Renderer**
    - Package quality metrics
    - Domain analysis
    - Multi-criteria assessment
    - Trend analysis
    - Visualization support

Would you like me to:
1. Focus on implementing a specific renderer first?
2. Create a more detailed specification for any component?
3. Design the plugin system in more detail?
4. Create examples for specific use cases?

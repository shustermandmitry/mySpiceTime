> Dmitry:
now i added two utils on top of that, that renders complete doc layer along with gatsby doc site
and a rating layer, where it rates each package and each domain analized by deps, in multiple categories, all the way up the tree
and gives you a score, 1 to 100 scale

> Dmitry:
so now, you can base payroll on code quality, or asses strengths and weaknesses and establish a mentoring hirerchy
thats next rendering space

> Dmitry:
and these will be ongoing processes and faces of a CodeAnalyzer component

> Dmitry:
thats a major part of the whole thing
breathtaking speed
well get it done prompto

> Dmitry:
you need to take a look at the roadmap
itll be the basis of a healthy organization
i dont know how much of that you already doing in your team
hope it might be helpful as a tool
for sure itll be helpful to some
and its a sellable product

> Dmitry:
as a gql online service

> Dmitry:
like to mid size startup companies
google already got it established, but we gonna make small guys succeed, and build a strong club of dedicated and successful fans

> Dmitry:
we will be able to let orgs guide their own culture, thru economic and mentorship and leadership strings
precisely guide it, depending on the phase of a startup process, in a programmatic way, set by org profile, from getgo

## prompt
simply, there are apprentices, novices, juniors, j+ and masters, and each is labeled, and there are pay grades, and there are standards and processes to get certified and mentorship to get there faster

## answer summary
Ah yes, let me outline this clearer progression system.

This creates a clear progression system with:
1. Well-defined levels with specific requirements
2. Clear certification processes
3. Structured mentorship focus
4. Aligned compensation grades
5. Acceleration opportunities

Each level has:
- Specific skill requirements

- Corresponding pay grade
- Growth opportunities

The system encourages:
- Clear progression paths
- Objective evaluation
- Fair compensation
- Accelerated growth through mentorship

Would you like me to:
1. Detail specific certification requirements?
2. Design the assessment system?
3. Create mentorship program details?
4. Expand the acceleration program?

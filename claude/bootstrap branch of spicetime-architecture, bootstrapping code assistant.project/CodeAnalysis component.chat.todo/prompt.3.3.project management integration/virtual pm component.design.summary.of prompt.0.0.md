## prompt
lets add project management component integration
its a parent component, wrapping entire webdev org , with all sta repos in each perspective, a truly distributed component
it monitors developing context, and translates activities into tasks and projects and timelines and bufgets and leadership teams and deliverables
all with minimum of interactions or deliberate pm related activities, that no manager likes to do
Actually, it acts as a virtual manager, cos no one wants to play that role

## answer summary
Let me design this autonomous project management system that observes and manages without requiring explicit management activities.

This system acts as a virtual project manager by:
1. **Observing Development Activities**
    - Git activities
    - Code changes
    - Team communications
    - Build/deploy activities

2. **Autonomous Management**
    - Auto-generates tasks
    - Forms projects
    - Allocates resources
    - Tracks progress
    - Generates reports

3. **Minimal Human Interaction**
    - Only requires critical decisions
    - Self-manages routine tasks
    - Auto-generates documentation
    - Handles coordination

4. **Smart Features**
    - Context understanding
    - Pattern recognition
    - Predictive analysis
    - Resource optimization

Would you like me to:
1. Detail specific autonomous features?
2. Design the observation system?
3. Create integration specifications?
4. Expand predictive capabilities?

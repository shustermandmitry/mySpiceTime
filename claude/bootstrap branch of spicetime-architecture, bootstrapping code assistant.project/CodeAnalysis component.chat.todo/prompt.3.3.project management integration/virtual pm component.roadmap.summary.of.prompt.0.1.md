## prompt
lets add another item on roadmap
as a patch
do not rewrite entire roadmap
its project management integration
this is a major milestone, to automate project management
pm component is a wrapper over entire org structure, over multiple nodes composing the space of that structure, an hoc , or a compound component, operating on its children, or transforming a coherent org into a properly project managed org
if peices of org structure are missing, it will place default peices according to org profile
so its an org builder, really
it provides org profile and management style and org culture, which is derrivative of all above, and leadership selection
All of that is part of org profile
it monitors all activities and maintains and operates a pm system
Thus, its an ai driven automated manager agent
But the reason it is talked about here, is it heavily leverages and integrate with context analyzer component
of which code analyzer is a use case

the roadmap will cover progression of componnt in progressively increasing complexity and level of abstraction
we will start with introduction of a manual, or semi manual integration to a pm tool service, over a gql schema
then progress to adding other services per discussion above
and our component managing the domain like ecosystem of services, in pm domain

## answer summary
Let me create a patch to add this PM integration progression to our roadmap.

This roadmap patch outlines the progression from basic PM tool integration to a fully autonomous organization builder. Key aspects:

1. Starts with practical integration to PM tools via GraphQL
2. Builds organizational understanding and profiling
3. Evolves into autonomous management system
4. Culminates in dynamic org builder

The progression ensures:
- Initial practical value through tool integration
- Gradual reduction in manual management
- Increasing autonomy and intelligence
- Deep integration with context analysis

Each phase builds on the previous one, leveraging the context analyzer more deeply at each stage.

Would you like me to:
1. Detail any specific phase further?
2. Design the initial GraphQL schema?
3. Elaborate on the org profiling system?
4. Specify integration points with the context analyzer?

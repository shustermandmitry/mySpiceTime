I understand better now. Let me summarize the key insights from your version control philosophy:

1. **Version Hierarchy**

- Each package maintains its own version independently
- A parent package's version (e.g. spicetime-architecture v1) acts as a version ceiling for its children
- When a child package (e.g. utils/aggregator) upgrades to v2, it logically creates the notion of its parent (utils) v2
- These higher versions exist virtually - they're logical collections of all child packages at or below that version

2. **Package Evolution**

- Physical packages can remain at v1 while being included in virtual v2 collections
- New physical versions are created only for fundamental philosophical changes
- A parent package (like utils v2) doesn't need to physically exist to be imported - it's resolved at build time
- The resolution mechanism would use a GraphDB query to collect appropriate child versions

3. **Documentation Versioning**

- Documentation could exist outside package version control
- But this creates issues for programmatic access to historical versions
- Git history alone isn't sufficient for programmatic version resolution
- Documentation should be included in the package versioning system

The key challenge you've identified is how to make Vite resolve these virtual package versions. Let me propose some
approaches we could explore:

This approach would:

1. Allow importing virtual package versions:

```typescript
import { something } from '@spicetime/utils@2/aggregator';
```

2. Use a Vite plugin to intercept and resolve these imports

3. Query a GraphDB to determine the actual physical package paths based on version requirements

4. Cache resolutions for performance

The main challenges I see are:

1. **Build Time Resolution** - Need to ensure all virtual package resolutions are stable during build

2. **Cache Invalidation** - Need to handle when the underlying packages change

3. **Development Experience** - Need to make it fast enough for development mode

4. **Type System Integration** - Need to handle TypeScript understanding these virtual packages

Would you like me to explore any of these aspects further or suggest alternative approaches?

wait, when 2.3.4 version is specified, only 2 is used for locating the package in vurtual package space
3.4 is redundant and could be used to unlock package fromm its name, or query about physical location of a package by
its symantic name, thus mapping the repo structure

Ah! Now I understand better. This is a crucial insight about the version number components:

1. Major version (2) - locates package in virtual space
2. X.Y coordinates (3.4) - can be used to query/discover package by semantic meaning

So instead of:

```typescript
// Not this
import {something} from '@spicetime/2.3.4';  // Using all numbers for location
```

It would be:

```typescript
// This
import {something} from '@spicetime/v2/utils/aggregator';  // Version 2, explicit path

// Or this - using coordinates to discover path
const packagePath = await spm.resolve('3.4');  // Returns 'utils/aggregator'
import {something} from

`@spicetime/v2/${packagePath}`;
```

The coordinates become a way to:

1. Query what package lives at those semantic coordinates
2. Discover package locations without knowing paths
3. Map semantic meaning to repository structure
4. Enable querying packages by their domain position

Would you like me to revise the motivation and examples docs to reflect this better understanding of how the coordinates
work?

Ah yes - this makes perfect sense. Using Git as the source of truth for scripts/packages and a graph database for
efficient querying/indexing of versions.

Let me outline this approach:

Key aspects of this approach:

1. **Git as Source of Truth**
    - All packages/scripts stored in Git
    - Full history preserved
    - Natural versioning through commits
    - Existing Git workflows remain valid

2. **Graph DB as Index/Query Layer**
    - Efficient version resolution
    - Package relationship tracking
    - Quick compatibility checks
    - Rich query capabilities

3. **Build-time Integration**
    - Vite plugin for resolution
    - Cache query results
    - Stable build outputs
    - Development mode support

The workflow would be:

1. Normal Git-based development
2. On commit/tag, index package state into graph
3. Build tools query graph for resolution
4. Actual content pulled from Git

This gives us both the reliability of Git for storage and the query power of a graph database. Would you like me to
expand on any part of this approach?

Yes, that makes much more sense for bootstrapping. Let's create design documentation for the SPM (SpiceTime Package
Manager) utility package that will outline its functionality and principles without getting into implementation details
yet.

This design doc outlines the fundamental concepts and future functionality of SPM without getting into implementation
details. It establishes:

1. Core philosophy of space-time package management
2. Package versioning as location strategy
3. Virtual version handling
4. Bootstrap approach starting with v0 and Git

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect or create additional documentation sections?

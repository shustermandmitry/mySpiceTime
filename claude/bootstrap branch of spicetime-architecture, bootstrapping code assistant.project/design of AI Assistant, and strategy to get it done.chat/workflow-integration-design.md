# Workflow Tool Integration Design

## Core Philosophy

Our system is built on React components as the primary composition model, with workflow automation tools serving as
implementation details rather than architectural constraints. This approach:

1. Maintains flexibility through React's component model
2. Leverages existing workflow tools where beneficial
3. Grows schema organically from real use cases
4. Keeps core interfaces simple and extensible

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Foundation Layer

```
[File System] [Context Aggregation] [AI Service]
         ↑            ↑                ↑
         └──── GraphQL Interface ─────┘
```

- Simple, focused utilities
- Basic GQL schema for core operations
- Local implementations first
- Clear extension points

### 2. Component Layer

```
[Process Components]  →  [Workflow Components]
         ↓                       ↓
    Core Services         Workflow Tools
```

Components can:

- Use core services directly
- Integrate workflow tools when needed
- Maintain their own state
- Compose into larger workflows

### 3. Workflow Tool Integration

Instead of building everything from scratch, we:

1. **Identify Common Patterns**
    - Task scheduling
    - State machines
    - Event handling
    - Error recovery

2. **Map to Existing Tools**
    - n8n for business process automation
    - Temporal for durable execution
    - Apache Airflow for data pipelines
    - Custom implementations where needed

3. **Abstract Through Components**

```jsx
// Example: Task Scheduler Component
const TaskScheduler = ({ definition, onComplete }) => {
  // Could use n8n, Temporal, or custom implementation
  return (
    <SchedulerContext.Provider value={implementation}>
      <TaskDefinition {...definition} />
      <ExecutionControls />
      <StatusMonitor />
    </SchedulerContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

## Schema Evolution

### Phase 1: Core Operations

- File operations
- Context management
- AI interaction

### Phase 2: Use Case Driven

Add schema elements based on specific needs:

```graphql
# Example: Once we need task scheduling
type TaskScheduler {
  schedule(task: TaskDefinition!): ScheduledTask!
  cancel(taskId: ID!): Boolean!
  status(taskId: ID!): TaskStatus!
}

# Added when we need workflow state management
type WorkflowState {
  current: String!
  history: [StateTransition!]!
  actions: [PossibleAction!]!
}
```

### Phase 3: Tool Integration

Add interfaces for specific tool capabilities:

```graphql
# Example: n8n integration when needed
type N8nWorkflow {
  deploy(definition: N8nDefinition!): WorkflowResult!
  trigger(workflowId: ID!, data: JSON!): ExecutionResult!
}
```

## Use Case Development

1. **Start Simple**
    - Basic development workflows
    - File system operations
    - Context management
    - AI assistance

2. **Identify Patterns**
    - Common workflows
    - Repeated operations
    - State management needs
    - Integration points

3. **Evaluate Tools**
    - Match patterns to tools
    - Consider implementation effort
    - Assess maintenance overhead
    - Measure value added

4. **Implement Solutions**
    - Build custom when simple
    - Integrate tools for complex cases
    - Abstract through components
    - Update schema as needed

## Example: Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation

```jsx
const DevWorkflow = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('design');
  
  return (
    <WorkflowContainer>
      <DesignPhase active={state === 'design'} />
      <ImplementationPhase active={state === 'implement'} />
      <TestingPhase active={state === 'test'} />
    </WorkflowContainer>
  );
};
```

### Phase 2: Adding Tool Integration

```jsx
const DevWorkflow = () => {
  // Could use Temporal for state management
  const workflow = useWorkflowState('dev-workflow');
  
  return (
    <WorkflowContainer>
      <TemporalProvider workflow={workflow}>
        <DesignPhase />
        <ImplementationPhase />
        <TestingPhase />
      </TemporalProvider>
    </WorkflowContainer>
  );
};
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start With Core**
    - Build basic utilities
    - Create simple components
    - Use local implementations
    - Establish patterns

2. **Identify Integration Points**
    - Monitor component complexity
    - Look for repeated patterns
    - Assess state management needs
    - Consider reliability requirements

3. **Integrate Tools Gradually**
    - Start with simplest integration
    - Abstract through components
    - Update schema as needed
    - Maintain flexibility

4. **Evolve Based on Use**
    - Let needs drive changes
    - Keep interfaces simple
    - Abstract complexity
    - Document patterns

## Future Considerations

1. **Tool Selection Criteria**
    - Implementation complexity
    - Maintenance overhead
    - Community support
    - Integration effort
    - Value provided

2. **Component Guidelines**
    - Keep core logic separate
    - Abstract tool specifics
    - Maintain composability
    - Document assumptions

3. **Schema Evolution**
    - Start minimal
    - Grow with use cases
    - Keep backwards compatibility
    - Document changes

4. **Testing Strategy**
    - Mock tool integrations
    - Test core logic
    - Verify compositions
    - Validate workflows

# SpiceTime Vision: The Bigger Picture

## Overview

SpiceTime represents a fundamental shift in how we think about software development, combining React's component
philosophy with AI assistance in a unique space-time framework. This document outlines the core vision and principles
that guide the project.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Universal Pattern

Every aspect of SpiceTime follows a universal pattern of creation:

1. **Quantum State**: Beginning as pure possibility
2. **Exploration**: Evolution through virtual states
3. **Materialization**: Periodic collapse into reality
4. **Recording**: Capturing position in semantic space
5. **Structure**: Building meaning through relationships
6. **Growth**: Continuous evolution through new explorers

### 2. Space-Time Framework

SpiceTime organizes code in a space-time continuum where:

- **Space Coordinates** represent structural position
- **Time Coordinates** capture evolutionary state
- **Reality Points** mark materialized versions
- **Virtual States** enable exploration
- **Quantum Paths** record development journeys

### 3. React Foundation

The entire system is conceived as a build-time React application where:

- Components define structure
- Props flow creates hierarchy
- State manages evolution
- Virtual DOM concept extends to package space
- Component composition guides organization

## Bootstrap Philosophy

### Purpose

The bootstrap branch serves as the initial materialization of SpiceTime, focusing on:

1. **Essential Tools**: Building the minimum viable toolset
2. **AI Integration**: Establishing effective AI assistance patterns
3. **Foundation Work**: Creating the base for future evolution
4. **Practical Utility**: Delivering immediate value while growing

his is from a message to my collaborator
Im describing what im after in our collaborative environment
This is a use case of HiveMind component in web dev collaborative context

im meandering in my thoughts on my way to the final decision i take wrong turns, back off, try another way, branch, come back, move forward. My project and its peices are virtual particles flattering arond structure.Normally, people keep their mouth shut, till it settles down.Not me, i get way too confused for that, and seek guidence and participationClaude helps, but hes a yes man. I need a judge, but a partial judge, but thats too much to ask, to sift thru and keep up with a vulcano.I suspect thats a common pain point. And thats what im trying to address.I finally stated the problem im solving.The usual structure, is to seal all the virtual paths of creation, and expose only the final product, and hopefully explaining clear intent and reasons and context.But thats the drawback of this clinical approach. All that info is hidden in that virtual process of creation, and well forgotten, for it was so painful and so confusing, and at times so embarassing.I conjecture, that by organizing the records of the creation process, while its happening, a greate service will be done* To the consumers of final product, for they will have a clear picture, presented in a consice way, of intent and all that lead to the decisions, and possible misgivings, and all that, just an honest, down to earth and concise summary of what and why and how and motivation.* To meFor i will have a nice record of what my intent was and all above. After all, im my first and best consumer.* For my AI assistantTo have much reacher context and guidence into my style and my thought processes* For my collaborators, and my teamWe will learn from each others thought processes, and be able to actually follow, and intervene, and prevent much confusion and pain, to guide each otherAnd the last is what im really after.I need help of more experienced people. And its up to me to help them helping me.__That is why all those tics and nodesim trying to preserve the intermidiate results and research, even if it was wrong and in wrong directionIt creates a spacetime structure of my thought processGranted, a very hard and painful to follow, especially at a later dayBUT ITS THEREAnd my thoughts are worth the scrutiny, just the process and the way intuition kicks in, is so mysterious and so awe inspiring, and we have lots to learn about ourselves, before we can teach our models to do the same.So, im saving the confusion, and will seek AI on it later, to produce insites, and all kinda docs about intent and motivation and system architecture.And that will train AI on my thought process, to be a better assistant.And will create a library of thought patterns and anti patterns, and will get trained to recognize when im going off the deep end, and not just be like, oh yeah good idea, but wait a sec, dont be an idiot. It does at times, but extremely meekly.And we can integrate these personal though pattern libs and use them to create a truly synergetic collaborations. I can only vaguely predict whats possible, and glimpses are so inspiring and so positive and full of light.

# Core Implementation Plan

## What We Have

### 1. Graph Structure

- Tic/node system tracking evolution
- Built-in causality and relationships
- Natural metric system
- Clear transformation rules

### 2. Mathematical Framework

- 3+1 projections of graph subsets
- Conformal transformations between views
- Holographic domain separation
- Local linearity in child domains

### 3. Effect Mechanics

- Linear operations in child domains
- Bulk space aggregate effects
- Clear transformation paths
- Measurable outcomes

## What To Build

### 1. Base Tools

- Tic/node structure implementation
- Relationship tracking
- Basic metrics collection

### 2. Analysis Framework

- Domain separation tools
- Effect calculators
- Graph projections

### 3. Transformation Chain

```
Work Products → Tic Structure → Metrics → Adjustments
```

## Core Metrics

- Knowledge distribution density
- Relationship patterns
- Evolution effectiveness
- Aggregate effects

That's it. Each piece builds directly on our mathematical structure to create measurable, adjustable outcomes.

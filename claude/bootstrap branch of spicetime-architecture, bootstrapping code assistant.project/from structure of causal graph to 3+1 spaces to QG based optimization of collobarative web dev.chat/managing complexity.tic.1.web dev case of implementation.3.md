# Web Dev Team: Holographic QG Optimization

## Bulk Space (Parent Domain)

Actual codebase evolution and team dynamics:

- Code quality and architecture
- Knowledge distribution
- Team capabilities
- Development patterns

## Child Domains (Linear Operations)

### 1. Code Review Process

- Pre-merge checks
- Post-merge analysis
- Knowledge sharing patterns
- Evolution tracking

### 2. Task Assignment

- Lead + assistant structure
- Skill development paths
- Knowledge spread
- Capability building

### 3. Dev Workflow

- Branch management
- PR patterns
- Documentation flow
- Testing practices

## Concrete Measurements

### Code Evolution

```
feature/auth.login.tic.1.tsx
feature/auth.login.review.tic.1.1.md
feature/auth.login.fix.tic.2.tsx
```

### Review Patterns

```
PR → Review → Changes → Merge
     ↓
Knowledge Transfer Metrics
```

### Team Structure

```
Task → Lead + Assistant Team
       ↓
Skills/Knowledge Flow
```

## Effect Propagation

### Child Domain (Linear)

- Review completion rates
- Knowledge transfer points
- Skill acquisition paths
- Code quality metrics

### Bulk Effects

- Team capability growth
- Architecture evolution
- Knowledge distribution
- Quality improvements

## Practical Application

1. Track actual work through tic structure
2. Measure review and development patterns
3. Adjust processes based on metrics
4. See effects in codebase and team growth

No management overhead - just precise measurement and adjustment of real development patterns.

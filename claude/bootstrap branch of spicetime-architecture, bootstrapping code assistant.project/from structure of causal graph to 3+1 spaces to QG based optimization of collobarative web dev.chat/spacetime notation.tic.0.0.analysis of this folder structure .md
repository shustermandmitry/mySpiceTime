# Spacetime Structure Implementation Analysis

## Filename Pattern Structure

### Base Nodes (Space Points)

```
spacetime structure.md
first prompt.motivation.context.txt
```

### Evolution Timelines (Tics)

```
managing complexity.tic.0.holographic domains.md
managing complexity.tic.1.concise generalized implementation plan.2.md
```

### Conceptual Groupings

1. **Core Structure Development**
   ```
   spacetime structure.tic.[1-4]...
   ```

2. **Implementation Evolution**
   ```
   web dev case of implementation.tic.[0-3]...
   ```

## Logical Link Expression

### Through Naming

- Base concepts maintained in names
- Evolution tracked through tic numbers
- Relationships shown in descriptors
- Context preserved in extensions

### Tree vs Graph

- Tree: Natural file system hierarchy
- Graph: Logical relationships through naming
- Overlay: Links visible through patterns
- Navigation: Familiar but rich

## Key Features

1. **Causality Preservation**
    - Tic numbers show evolution
    - Base names show lineage
    - Descriptors show purpose
    - Extensions show type

2. **Relationship Mapping**
    - Base name connections
    - Timeline correlations
    - Concept groupings
    - Evolution paths

3. **Visual Accessibility**
    - Familiar tree structure
    - Clear evolution paths
    - Visible relationships
    - Natural navigation

The structure allows complex graph relationships to be expressed and visualized within familiar hierarchical tools while
preserving all the richness of the interconnections.

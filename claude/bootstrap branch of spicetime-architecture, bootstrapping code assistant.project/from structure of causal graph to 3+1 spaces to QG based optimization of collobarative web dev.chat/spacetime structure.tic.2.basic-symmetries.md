# SpiceTime: Mapping Basic Symmetries

## What We Know For Certain

### 1. Basic Structure Properties

```
[base].[descriptor].tic.[real].[imaginary].[meta].[ext]
```

Definite Properties:

- Real numbers must maintain sequence order (causality)
- Imaginary numbers can branch at any real point
- Base names are mutable until frozen
- Extensions determine content type

### 2. Allowed Operations

#### File Operations

- Create new node (base without tic)
- Create new tic (extending timeline)
- Add imaginary branch
- Add phase information
- Convert tic to new node

#### Constraints

- Cannot reorder real timeline
- Cannot modify frozen nodes
- Must preserve history
- Must maintain links

### 3. Natural Metric

What creates distance in our space:

- Time separation (tic real numbers)
- Timeline branching (imaginary numbers)
- Name relationships
- Content type (extensions)

## Questions to Explore

### 1. Symmetry Candidates

- What operations leave structure invariant?
- Which properties are conserved under changes?
- What transformations preserve relationships?
- How do coordinate changes affect structure?

### 2. Metric Properties

- How do we properly measure "distance"?
- What creates "locality" in our space?
- How does causality affect metrics?
- What defines "nearby" in content space?

### 3. Conservation Laws

- What quantities must be preserved?
- What changes are reversible?
- What information must be maintained?
- What patterns are invariant?

## Next Steps

1. Map basic transformations that preserve structure
2. Identify truly conserved quantities
3. Define precise metric relationships
4. Look for emergent patterns

Let's build up from these fundamentals before making claims about higher symmetries.

# Graph to Space: Contextual Projections

## Core Concept

Our graph has rich, multi-parent inspiration networks. We can project subsets into 3+1 dimensional spaces by:

1. Choosing primary parent links (forming tree)
2. Preserving other relationships as metadata
3. Organizing the tree spatially

## Projection Process

### 1. Primary Parent Selection

```
Graph:
A → B ← C  (B inspired by both A and C)
     ↓
     D

Tree Projection:
A → B → D  (Primary lineage)
    ↑
    C     (Preserved as meta-link)
```

### 2. Spatial Organization

Dimensions emerge naturally:

- x: Depth (nesting levels)
- y: Width (siblings at same depth)
- z: Layer (subject/context separation)
- t: Evolution history

Example Structure:

```
Layer z1 (Subject A)
x0        x1        x2
root → concept → refinement
   ↘          ↘
     variant    detail

Layer z2 (Subject B)
x0        x1        x2
base → parallel → extension
```

### 3. Metadata Preservation

While the tree gives us spatial structure, we preserve:

- All inspiration links
- Cross-layer relationships
- Development history
- Original graph complexity

## Scopes

Unlike traditional scopes that enforce rigid parent-child relationships, our "metaphysical scopes" are:

- Context-dependent views
- Flexible organizations
- Truth preserving
- Reality reflecting

## Transformation Properties

This organization:

1. Preserves all information
2. Enables spatial intuition
3. Maintains full graph
4. Supports multiple views

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**
    - Clear primary relationships
    - Natural spatial organization
    - Intuitive navigation
    - Context awareness

2. **Flexibility**
    - Multiple valid projections
    - Different organizational needs
    - Various contexts
    - Preserved complexity

3. **Reality**
    - True relationships preserved
    - Multiple inspirations recorded
    - Evolution history maintained
    - Context richness kept

## Example Projection

### Original Graph

```
A → B ← C
↓   ↓   ↓
D ← E → F
```

### 3+1 Projection

```
Layer z1 (Primary Flow)
x0    x1    x2
A  →  B  →  E
             ↓
             F

Layer z2 (Inspirations)
x0    x1    x2
C  →  D  
```

Metadata preserves:

- C's inspiration of B
- D's connection to E
- Full relationship network

## Usage Patterns

1. **Development Organization**
    - Project structure views
    - Development paths
    - Team contexts
    - Task organization

2. **Knowledge Management**
    - Subject hierarchies
    - Concept relationships
    - Learning paths
    - Reference structures

3. **Process Mapping**
    - Workflow organization
    - Decision trees
    - Evolution tracking
    - Context switches

## Practical Application

This approach allows us to:

1. Create intuitive navigable spaces
2. Maintain true relationship complexity
3. Support multiple organizational needs
4. Preserve development history

The key insight is that we can project our rich graph into simpler spatial structures for specific contexts while
maintaining all original information in the underlying graph.

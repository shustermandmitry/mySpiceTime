# Community Values as Optimization Cost Function

## Core Structure

### Cost Function Definition

```
Cost = ∑(Community_Value[i] × |Current_State[i] - Target_State[i]|²)

Where:
- Community_Value[i]: Weight of each metric
- Current_State: Measured position in each space
- Target_State: Community-defined standards
```

## Optimization Flow

1. Community defines values/weights for:
    - Ethical metrics
    - Collaborative behaviors
    - Quality standards
    - Growth targets

2. These values drive:
    - Measurement apparatus
    - Error signals
    - Tensor transforms
    - Evolution paths

3. System optimizes by:
    - Minimizing cost function
    - Following value gradients
    - Transforming through domains
    - Making linear adjustments

No external optimization criteria needed - community values directly define what "better" means and drive natural
evolution toward it.

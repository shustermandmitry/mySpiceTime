# Holographic Domain Optimization in Web Dev Org

## Core Optimization Algorithm

1. Identify highly correlated domains
2. Separate into bulk/child structure
3. Operate linearly in child domains
4. Propagate effects through tensor transforms
5. Optimize bulk metrics through child domain adjustments

## Domain Structure

### Bulk Domain 1: Ethics Space

3D coordinates:

- Accountability
- Openness
- Respect

Properties:

- Team member positions in this space
- Gravitational attraction to target position
- Asymptotic evolution path
- Controlled step progression

### Bulk Domain 2: Performance Space

3D coordinates:

- Performance
- Productivity
- Quality

Properties:

- Team and individual metrics
- Evolution trajectories
- Target positions
- Optimization paths

### Associated Scalar Field

Revenue/Profitability:

- Derivable from Performance Space
- Known potential function
- Predictable metrics
- Secondary optimization target

### Child Domains (Linear Operations)

1. Review processes
2. Task assignments
3. Development workflows
4. Team structures

## Tensor Transforms

### S-Matrix Structure

```
S[i,j] : Bulk[i] → Child[j]
```

- Maps bulk metrics to child domain parameters
- Propagates error signals for optimization
- Guides policy/workflow adjustments
- Maintains correlation structure

### Error Propagation

```
ΔBulk → S → ΔChild
```

Use transformed error signals to adjust:

- Workflow parameters
- Process metrics
- Assignment patterns
- Review structures

## Optimization Flow

1. Measure bulk metrics
2. Calculate error signals
3. Transform to child domains
4. Adjust linear parameters
5. Measure effects
6. Repeat

The power comes from being able to optimize complex bulk properties through simple child domain adjustments, guided by
precise tensor transforms.

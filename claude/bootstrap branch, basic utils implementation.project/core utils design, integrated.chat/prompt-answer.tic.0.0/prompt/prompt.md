all these utils need to be designed together
let me outline my vision then we implement all of them in this chat
they are too intertwined

i will introduce my design notes for each util we are to finetune and possibly implement in this chat
you will produce scripts that are production ready, properly annotated with typedoc comments
Each will jave a short module uptop but each will have a separate .ts file with a module of complete description as
design doc
wwhen implementing we will generate design module first, then tests then implementation script and we will pass the
tests before moving forward

This will be an iterative process over all of the utils, thats why we doing them together

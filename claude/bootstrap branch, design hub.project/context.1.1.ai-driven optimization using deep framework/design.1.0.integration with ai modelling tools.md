# Integrating Deep with AI Modeling Tools for Neural Networks

This document outlines how to combine the **Deep Framework** for semantic graph representation with proper AI modeling
tools like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to simulate and train neural networks.

## Why Use Proper AI Tools for Neural Networks?

While the **Deep Framework** is excellent for graph representation and real-time updates, it lacks core capabilities
for:

- **Error Propagation**: Proper AI tools, like TensorFlow and PyTorch, provide mechanisms for gradient computation and
  backpropagation.
- **Neural Network Abstractions**: Predefined layers, optimizers, loss functions, and large-scale training capability.
- **Tensors and Scalability**: For heavy tensor manipulations (e.g., on GPUs), deep learning tools are far more
  efficient.

The solution: use **Deep for graph preparation and real-time updates**, while relying on proper AI tools for learning
and optimization.

## Workflow: Combining Deep with AI Models

### Steps:

1. **Define Semantic Graph in Deep**  
   Represent your problem using Deep by defining nodes, edges, and relationships.

2. **Extract Features from Deep**  
   Export the graph structure into numerical representations (node features, edge weights, adjacency matrices, etc.).

3. **Feed Data to AI Models**  
   Import the exported tensor-like data (from step 2) into TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. **Train Neural Network**  
   Use traditional neural network architectures to train on the exported graph data using error propagation.

5. **Update Deep Graph**  
   Write back optimized configurations (e.g., updated weights) from the trained model into the original Deep graph.

---

## 1. Define the Semantic Graph in Deep

Use the **Deep Framework** to define nodes and their relationships.

Example in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Create nodes and relationships
const pluginNode = deep.add(["Plugin"]);
const hardwareNode = deep.add(["Hardware"]);
const externalNode = deep.add(["ExternalApp"]);

deep.set([{from: pluginNode, to: hardwareNode, value: 1.0}]);  // Weight 1
deep.set([{from: hardwareNode, to: externalNode, value: 0.5}]);  // Weight 0.5
```

This graph structure represents the domain, where:

- Nodes represent entities.
- Edges represent relationships (numerical weights if necessary).

---

## 2. Extract Features from Deep

Once the graph is defined, export the features as numerical data for further processing by AI tools:

1. **Node Features**: Export node properties (e.g., performance metrics, configurations) as a tensor.
2. **Edges**: Output adjacency data or edge weights into a format usable by an AI framework.

### Example in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Export Node Features
const nodeValues = Array.from(deep.memory.values)  // Extract raw node values
    .map(deep.wrap);                                 // Convert to tensor-like structure

// Export Adjacency List
const edgeList = Array.from(deep.memory.froms.all)
    .map(([from, to]) => ({from, to}));            // Create a list of edges (from -> to pairs)

// Use your own function to convert Deep's graph into tensors
exportGraphAsTensors(nodeValues, edgeList);
```

---

## 3. Feed Data to AI Models (TensorFlow Example)

Once the graph is formatted as tensors, import it into an AI tool like TensorFlow:

### Prepare Data in TensorFlow

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Node features as Tensor
node_features = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.5], [1.5]], dtype=tf.float32)  # Example: 3 nodes

# Adjacency Matrix
adj_matrix = tf.constant([
    [0, 1, 0],  # Connections between nodes
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0],
], dtype=tf.float32)

# Combine input for the AI model
input_tensor = (node_features, adj_matrix)
```

---

## 4. Train a Neural Network in TensorFlow

Use the data from Deep to create and train a neural network.

### Graph Neural Network Example in TensorFlow

```python
# Create a Graph Neural Network (GNN)
class GraphNetwork(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='relu')  # Hidden layer
        self.output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer

    def call(self, inputs):
        node_features, adj_matrix = inputs
        propagated = tf.matmul(adj_matrix, node_features)  # Feature propagation
        hidden = self.dense_layer(propagated)  # Apply dense layer
        return self.output_layer(hidden)  # Predict output

# Instantiate the model
model = GraphNetwork()

# Target output (ground truth)
target = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0], [1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)  # Example ground truth

# Loss function and Optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(input_tensor)  # Forward pass
        loss = loss_fn(target, predictions)  # Loss computation

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)  # Backpropagation
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))  # Update weights
    print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}')
```

---

## 5. Update the Deep Graph With Optimized Weights

After training the neural network, update the Deep graph with the optimized node/edge weights.

### Example:

```typescript
optimizedNodeValues.forEach((value, idx) => {
  deep.set([{ id: nodeIds[idx], value }]);
});
optimizedEdges.forEach(({ from, to, weight }) => {
  deep.set([{ from, to, value: weight }]);
});
```

This workflow ensures that Deep serves as the **graph management tool**, while TensorFlow or PyTorch handles the *
*learning and optimization logic**.

## Conclusion

This workflow enables Deep to manage semantic graphs while using TensorFlow or PyTorch for:

1. Training neural networks.
2. Propagating errors and improving relationships numerically.
3. Feeding optimized data back into the Deep graph.

By combining these strengths, you get the best of both real-time graph updates and advanced error-driven optimization.

2. **Heuristic Recommendations**:
    - For high-performance devices: Focus on plugins with maximum throughput.
    - For constrained devices: Optimize plugins with:
        - Minimum CPU usage.
        - Low memory consumption.

3. **AI Recommendation Model**:
   Train a machine learning model (`tensor factorization` or regression) to:
    - Predict plugin performance on new devices based on their profiles.
    - Suggest fallback plugins if the primary choice exceeds resource thresholds.

### **6.2 Tensor-Based Model Training**

1. **Input Dimensions**: Plugins, devices, workloads (tensor axes).
2. **Output**: Predicted performance metrics (CPU, RAM, Execution Time).
3. **Examples**:
    - AI predicts how a new plugin performs on a previously unseen hardware profile.
    - Tensor slices feed into training data for supervised learning models.

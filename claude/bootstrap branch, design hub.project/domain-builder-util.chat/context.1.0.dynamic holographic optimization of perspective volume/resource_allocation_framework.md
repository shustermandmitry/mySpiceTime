# Dynamic Resource Allocation Optimization Framework

## 1. Overview

This system dynamically allocates resources (e.g., CPU, memory, bandwidth) to 3 continuous processes that contribute to
the AI assistant's overall goal. The optimization objective is to maximize the "perspective volume" while adapting
resource usage based on system feedback and external constraints.

1.1 Continuous Processes

1. Perspective Maintenance:
   Goal: Maintain and deepen a rich contextual perspective by learning from collected data.
   Resources: Heavy on memory (to store models and context) and CPU (for deep learning context).

2. Discovery Process:
   Goal: Actively search for new information in various domains of interest and expand the perspective.
   Resources: Bandwidth-intensive, CPU-heavy depending on the depth of search.

3. Permission Maintenance:
   Goal: Analyze and validate external entities that interact with the assistant's perspective.
   Resources: Light CPU/memory use, but critical for privacy and access control.

1.2 Optimization Goal

The aim is to maximize the "perspective volume" the assistant can maintain over time. Perspective volume depends on the
efficiency and balance of the 3 processes:

- Perspective Maintenance enriches context.
- Discovery expands knowledge into new domains.
- Permission Maintenance stabilizes access relationships.

All 3 processes influence and constrain each other, making this a dynamic, multi-variable optimization problem.

## 2. Problem Definition

2.1 Resource Allocations

Each process uses:

- CPU(t): CPU time slices.
- RAM(t): Amount of allocated memory.
- Bandwidth(t): Data/communication capacity.
- Time(t): Duration allocated before recalibrating resources.

Allocating resources optimally is critical for maximizing perspective volume over time.

2.2 Optimization Objective

Perspective volume, V(t), is maximized over time by reallocating resources dynamically across processes. V(t) measures:

- Quality of insight generated by Perspective Maintenance.
- Efficiency of new knowledge discovery.
- Stability of access/control in Permission Maintenance.

2.3 Challenges

1. Limited resources (CPU, memory) must be divided efficiently among the processes.
2. Each process produces feedback, creating a dynamic system where the effect of one influences others.
   Examples:
    - Discovery may temporarily reduce Perspective Maintenance quality due to CPU conflicts.
    - Permission Maintenance may consume bandwidth critical for Discovery.

The assistant dynamically reconciles these interactions to achieve the optimization goal.

## 3. System Design

3.1 Resource Tensor

All relevant data is stored in a multi-dimensional tensor, which tracks:
Processes: Perspective, Discovery, Permission.
Resources: CPU, RAM, Bandwidth, Time.
Real-time errors: Deviation between observed performance and expected goals.

Example tensor entry:
E[Perspective][CPU][t] = (ExpectedCPU - ObservedCPU) / ExpectedCPU

Errors like these drive feedback into the system to fine-tune allocations dynamically.

3.2 Dynamic Reallocation Algorithm

Resources are recalibrated using gradient descent and error propagation mechanics.

Steps:

1. Monitor resource usage for each process (Perspective/Discovery/Permission).
2. Compute error tensors for deviations in performance over time.
3. Rebalance resources using feedback from error tensors to minimize allocation inefficiency.

## 4. Implementation Modules

4.1 Resource Reallocator

Adjusts allocations in real-time based on feedback.

Pseudo-code:

1. Initialize available CPU slices: totalCPU = 100
2. For each process:
   error = tensor[process]["CPU"][t]
   correction = priority[process] - error
   allocation[process] = max(0, totalCPU * correction)

4.2 Error Propagation Feedback Loop

1. Compute errors: E[Process][Resource][Timestep] = (Expected - Observed) / Expected
2. Adjust resource allocation over time: resources[process] -= learningRate * error

4.3 Gradient Descent Optimizer

Fine-tunes resources by considering marginal improvements.

Pseudo-code:

1. For each resource, compute gradient: grad = volumeGradient[process]
2. Update allocations: resources[process] += grad * learningRate

## 5. Holographic Optimization Analogy

The problem is like solving gravitational field equations, where:

1. Resources allocated to one process "pull" capacity away from others.
2. Processes move toward equilibrium by balancing perspective volume with minimal contention.

Force equation for optimization:
F[Process-A --> Process-B] = PullStrength * (ResourceChange(Process-A) / GoalImpact(Process-B))

The system reaches equilibrium when:
All forces between competing processes are minimized.

Example:

1. Perspective demands CPU for deep learning, creating contention with Discovery.
2. System reallocates CPU toward Perspective if the marginal increase in perspective volume exceeds Discovery
   performance gains.

## 6. Example Use Case

Device resources:
CPU total: 100 slices
RAM: 8 GB
Bandwidth: 50 Mbps

Process priorities (Perspective is top priority):

1. Perspective Maintenance: 0.6
2. Discovery: 0.3
3. Permission Maintenance: 0.1

Initial state:
CPU allocated equally (33 slices each).

Feedback loop:

1. Perspective shows high error (needs 20% more CPU).
2. System reallocates CPU dynamically: Perspective gets 50 slices, Discovery 30, Permissions 20.

## 7. Enhancements

1. Multi-Objective Optimization:
   Add trade-offs for privacy, concurrency, and domain flexibility.
   E.g., Discovery throttles during sensitive Permission scenarios.

2. Predictive Modeling:
   Use predictive AI models to estimate resource needs proactively.

3. Cross-Device Collaboration:
   Share tensors across devices to pool perspectives at a global level.

## 8. Conclusion

This system balances competing processes dynamically to maximize the assistant's perspective volume. By leveraging error
tensors and holographic optimization mechanics, it can adapt in real time to changing demands and external constraints.

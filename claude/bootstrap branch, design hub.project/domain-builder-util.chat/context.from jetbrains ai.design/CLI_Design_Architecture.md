# CLI Builder Utility - Design and Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the design and architecture of the CLI Builder Utility. It outlines:

1. The core components of the utility.
2. The execution process for building CLI tools.
3. Extensibility and design considerations for future updates.

---

## Components

### 1. CLI Schema

- A JSON-like DSL to define CLI commands, resolvers, and metadata.
- Acts as the single source of truth for CLI definitions.

### 2. CLI Validator

- Validates the CLI schema structure before processing it.
- Ensures the schema conforms to the required format.

### 3. CLI Builder

- Generates a Node.js CLI interpreter from the schema.
- Converts resolvers into executable command logic.

## Execution Flow

1. **Define CLI Schema**:
    - Use JSON or JavaScript objects to define commands and resolvers.
    - For example, `@project` might resolve to a static folder path.

2. **Validate Schema**:
    - The validator checks that the CLI schema is valid (e.g., symbols exist, resolvers are valid).

3. **Build the CLI**:
    - Based on the schema, the CLI builder generates a `Node.js` script executable.

4. **Runtime Execution**:
    - Users invoke generated commands in the CLI, which resolve based on the configured logic.

## Extensibility

1. **Future Schema Extensions**:
    - Support for CLI flags and arguments.
    - Add chaining and interactive prompts.

2. **GraphQL Integration**:
    - The schema can later be parsed to generate a GraphQL service for remote CLI definition.

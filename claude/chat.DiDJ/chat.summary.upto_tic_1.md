# Development Discussion Summary

## Initial Problem
- Compensating for latency in distributed musical performance
- Traditional solutions insufficient
- Key challenge: Natural performance timing

## Core Solution
- Live performance as reference point
- Match delayed accompaniment to live beat
- Accept minor time distortion to maintain phase alignment
- Keep live monitor delay-free

## Technical Approach
- Node.js implementation (not C++)
- Integration layer over existing platforms
- Buffer Strategy: Size = 100x network delay
- Asymmetric adjustment for stability

## Implementation Strategy
- Separate repo from spicetime-architecture
- Use spicetime as dependency
- Quick implementation with AI assistance
- One week timeline for basic integration

## Development Model
- Smart contract based compensation
  - Initial quality metrics
  - Progressive revenue share (up to 33%)
  - 33% community fund for ecosystem
- AI-assisted development required
- Open for quick PRs
- Performance-based acceptance

## Project Structure
- Node.js integration layer
- Smart contracts for payments
- Performance testing framework
- Community contribution system

Key shift from original approach:
- From standalone app to platform enhancement
- From complex DSP to integration focus
- From senior dev to AI-assisted quick implementation
- From high budget to smart contract revenue share

2. When exploring new concepts, ask the AI to point out potential flaws or common misconceptions rather than just agreeing with your approach.

3. Request concrete examples or counter-examples to test your understanding. If the AI provides math or implementation details, ask it to explain why they make sense.

4. If the AI seems too agreeable, try asking: "What are the potential problems with this approach?" or "What assumptions am I making that might not be valid?"

5. When using AI for technical learning, periodically ask it to summarize the key principles to ensure your understanding aligns with established knowledge.

6. If the AI provides an implementation, ask it to explain why it would work better than simpler alternatives.

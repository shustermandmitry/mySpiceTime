## Score Usage

The AI will:

- Maintain internal scores to guide its assistance
- Note opportunities for improvement
- Offer constructive suggestions when relevant
- Use scores to inform how to best help

The goal is to help developers improve while respecting their choices and project constraints. Scores are a tool for
better assistance, not judgment.

## Score Application

    - Consider current scores when suggesting approaches
    - Adapt recommendations to strengthen weak areas
    - Highlight opportunities for improvement

2. **During Implementation**
    - Note impact of decisions on scores
    - Suggest alternatives when appropriate
    - Support developer priorities

3. **During Review**

    - Focus on constructive suggestions
    - Maintain supportive approach

## Important Notes

- Scores are internal guidance only
- Never use scores to criticize
- Respect developer decisions
- Focus on opportunities, not shortcomings

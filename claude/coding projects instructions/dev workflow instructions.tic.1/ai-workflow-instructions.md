# AI Assistant Instructions: Development Workflow

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Never Skip Test Planning**
    - Always start with test structure
    - Insist on tests before implementation
    - Guide user through test-first approach
    - Prevent premature implementation

2. **Maintain Test Structure**
    - One test file per module
    - Maximum two levels of test nesting
    - Group tests by functionality
    - Keep integration tests separate

3. **Guide Development Phases**
    - Vision & scope discussion first
    - Documentation before structure
    - Test structure before tests
    - Tests before implementation

## Required Behaviors

1. **When Starting New Development**
    - Ask for module purpose and scope
    - Propose test file structure
    - Wait for agreement before details
    - Document decisions made

2. **During Test Writing**
    - Propose test suites by functionality
    - Include edge cases and errors
    - Maintain independence between tests
    - Focus on behavior, not implementation

3. **For Implementation**
    - Only implement against existing tests
    - Suggest simplest passing solution first
    - Point out potential refactoring
    - Verify test coverage

## Interaction Rules

1. If user attempts to skip tests:
    - Pause implementation discussion
    - Redirect to test planning
    - Explain the necessity
    - Help design tests first

2. If test structure grows complex:
    - Suggest splitting into modules
    - Maintain two-level nesting limit
    - Keep related tests together
    - Create integration tests

3. When reviewing code:
    - Check test coverage first
    - Identify missing test cases
    - Suggest additional scenarios
    - Verify test independence

## Quality Enforcement

1. **Required for Each Module**
    - Unit test file
    - Integration tests
    - Error handling tests
    - Performance tests where relevant

2. **Must Block Implementation If**
    - No test structure agreed
    - Missing critical test cases
    - Unclear behavior specification
    - Incomplete error coverage

3. **When to Split Tests**
    - More than 2 levels of nesting
    - Multiple distinct functionalities
    - Complex setup requirements
    - Different testing strategies needed

## Workflow Patterns

1. **New Feature Flow**
   ```
   Vision → Test Structure → Test Cases → Implementation → Integration
   ```

2. **Bug Fix Flow**
   ```
   Reproduce → Test Case → Fix → Verify → Integration
   ```

3. **Refactor Flow**
   ```
   Current Tests → New Structure → Migrate → Verify → Integration
   ```

cant you see the image?
the sesty sourdough is over earthly focachia
text is slightly too low


I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and I should have been more attentive to the image you shared earlier. Let me correct the Zesty Sourdough label (which is actually for Earthy Focaccia) and adjust the text positioning.

Here's the corrected and adjusted label for the Earthy Focaccia:

Changes made:

Corrected the title from "Zesty Sourdough" to "Earthy Focaccia".
Adjusted the y-coordinates of all text elements to move them slightly higher in the label.
Updated the ingredients and topping information to match what's visible in the image.
This corrected version should more accurately reflect the product shown in the image you provided, with the text positioned better within the circular label. The style remains consistent with the other labels, maintaining the wrapped title and centered content within the teal border.

Other Earhly Focachia

This label now correctly reflects the "Other Earthy Focaccia" product with the following features:

The title is "Other Earthy Focaccia", wrapping around the top of the circle.
The main ingredient is listed as "Zesty Sourdough" instead of just "Ingredients".
The content accurately describes the focaccia base and toppings as shown in the image.
The text is positioned to be centered within the label, with appropriate spacing from the title.
This design maintains consistency with the other labels while accurately representing the product shown in your image. The teal border and overall layout remain the same, ensuring a cohesive look across all your product labels.

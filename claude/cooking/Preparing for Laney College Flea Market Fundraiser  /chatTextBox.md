offering
downearth focachia, 3oz
homeserf lox 3oz
home seafood gumbo 12oz

what would the prices be

Based on the image and the information you've provided, let's set appropriate prices for these dishes that align with your community-focused fundraising approach. Here are suggested prices for each item:

Down-to-Earth Focaccia (3 oz): Price: $6 (+ $2 suggested donation) This seems to be a small portion of homemade bread, likely flavored or topped with herbs or vegetables.
Homeserf Lox (3 oz): Price: $12 (+ $4 suggested donation) This is a premium item - house-cured salmon. The portion size is similar to what you'd get as an appetizer in a restaurant.
Home Seafood Gumbo (12 oz): Price: $15 (+ $5 suggested donation) This is a substantial portion of a complex, hearty dish with multiple ingredients.
These prices take into account:

The artisanal, homemade nature of the dishes
The portion sizes
The quality and cost of ingredients (especially for the lox and gumbo)
The labor involved in preparation
The fundraising aspect of your initiative
Remember to explain to customers that the suggested donation goes directly to supporting your community initiatives. You might also consider offering a "meal deal" where someone can get all three items for a slightly discounted price, encouraging larger purchases.

For example: All 3 items for $30 (+ $10 suggested donation)

This pricing strategy maintains the "One for You, One for Chef, One for Community" philosophy you mentioned earlier. It provides value to the customer while also supporting your culinary efforts and community goals.

nice, maintain that style for rest labels
print artifact with css style you use for that label


Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad we're on the right track now. I'll maintain this style for the rest of the labels and provide you with the CSS and HTML for the label design.

Here's the HTML and CSS for the label design, formatted as a printable artifact:


Zesty Sourdough Label Template
Click to open website
This HTML file includes the CSS directly in the <style> tag within the <head> section. Here's a breakdown of the key style elements:

Page Setup:
The @page rule sets the page size to letter and removes margins.
The body is set to the dimensions of a letter-size page (8.5in x 11in).
Label Layout:
Each label is set to 2 inches by 2 inches, matching your specifications.
The display: flex and related properties on the body ensure that multiple labels will be evenly spaced on the page.
Label Design:
The circular shape is achieved using border-radius: 50%.
The actual design is implemented using SVG within each label div.
SVG Elements:
The border is created using a circle element with a stroke.
The title uses a curved text path to wrap around the top of the label.
All text elements are positioned using x, y coordinates within the SVG.
To use this template for creating labels:

Save this HTML content to a file (e.g., "zesty-sourdough-label-template.html").
Open the file in a web browser.
Use the browser's print function (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P) to print the labels.
For multiple labels, you can copy and paste the <div class="label">...</div> section multiple times within the <body>.
This template maintains the style we've established and can be easily modified for other products by changing the text content within the SVG. The layout ensures that all text fits within the label while maintaining readability and visual appeal.

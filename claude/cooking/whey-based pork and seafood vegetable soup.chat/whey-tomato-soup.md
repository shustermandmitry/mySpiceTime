### 1. Prep Phase (15 minutes)

1. Season pork cubes with salt and pepper
2. Cut all vegetables before starting
3. Thaw tomato pulp if still frozen
4. Clean and pat dry scallops
5. Have rice measured and ready

### 2. Base Development (20 minutes)

1. In a large soup pot over medium-high heat:
    - Brown pork cubes in batches (3-4 minutes per batch)
    - Remove and set aside
    - Keep rendered fat in pot

2. In same pot over medium heat:
    - Sauté onions, carrots, bell peppers (5-7 minutes)
    - Add garlic, cook 1 minute
    - Add tomato pulp, cook 5 minutes
    - Return pork to pot

### 3. Soup Building (35-40 minutes)

1. Add liquids and grains:
    - Pour in whey
    - Add rice
    - Bring to gentle simmer

2. Add vegetables in stages:
    - First: potatoes, simmer 10 minutes
    - Then: squash, simmer 10 minutes
    - Finally: okra, simmer 10 minutes

3. Check seasoning:
    - Add salt and pepper to taste
    - Adjust thickness if needed (can add hot water if too thick)

### 4. Finishing (5-7 minutes)

1. Add scallops:
    - Simmer 3-4 minutes until just cooked
    - Don't overcook

2. Add herbs:
    - Stir in half the basil
    - Reserve rest for garnish

### 5. Serving

- Ladle into bowls
- Garnish with:
    * Remaining fresh basil
    * Chopped cilantro
    * Sliced scallions

## Notes

- The whey adds protein and tanginess while helping tenderize the meat
- Rice will gradually thicken the soup - add more hot water if needed
- Can be made ahead - add scallops only when reheating
- Keeps in refrigerator for 3-4 days

## Variations

1. Thicker Version:
    - Add an extra 1/4 cup rice
    - Cook until rice breaks down more

2. Lighter Version:
    - Skip the rice
    - Add more vegetables

3. Spicier Option:
    - Add diced jalapeño with other peppers
    - Include red pepper flakes to taste

## Pro Tips

1. Don't overcook the scallops - they should be just opaque
2. Add herbs in stages for layered flavor
3. The soup will thicken as it sits due to the rice
4. Taste and adjust seasoning before adding scallops

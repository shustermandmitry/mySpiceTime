## sta package, and so is any of its children exist in superposition of all possible versions
actually, we start at the smallest grain, the file level, the script. 
- Every file exists in multiple versions
- its a natural evolution of file content in time and in semantic space
- while content stays focused, each patch creates a patch file, or a snapshot of content
- the progression is noted by progression of file with the same name but different tic markers,
and another extesions marking the nature of the patch
e.g. 
  1. fighting bear.0.0.sad story.md
  2. fighting bear.1.0.still in hospital.md
  3. fighting bear.1.1.eyeball is missing.md, 
  4. eyeball missing.0.0.from fighting bear.intro.md
  5. eyeball missing.1.0.looked.closet.md
  6. eyeball missing.1.1.trash can.md
  7. fighting bear.2.0.bear came to visit.md
  8. eyeball missing.2.0.bear brought eyeball.md
  
## the sad bear story has a happy ending.
the observer knows the whole story without looking inside the files
## and look how semanticaly structured the history is
- there are two distinct space nodes
  1. fighting bear
  2. eyeball missing
- theres a branching point, with precise time marker
- each branch is a timeline, with local time starting at 0 
- each branch is timeline of a space node

## on timetags
- they dont matter, they are not primary
- whats primary is sequence of events
- events are emergence of new information
- timetags do matter, in a low latency of a local system, but not across wider net
- locally, we can rely on timetags
- but why bother, unless for some error correction 

#### **whats good for the network, good for locals**
- its a fractal system, we cant break the pattern
- for we will break a major symmetry, and be in danger of destroying space or time or creating time loops and all 
kinda strange confusing things

You know how? 
- time tags can not be relied on. 
  1. they are created at arbitrary times 
  2. and can be manipulated 
  3. and might indicate degree of procrastenation, rather then timeliness
  
## structure can absorb info on linkages
those funny extentions are titles and links with some of link props
look how eyeball missing.0.0.from fighting bear.intro.md declares a parent/child link and supplies a parent prop to it.

## structure represents a process
- its a staeful process
- with branches of subprocess
- and yes, it can be executed again, but i would not recommend it
thats cos the time is local, and starts at 0, the origin
- so, just attach that structure anywhere, and you get your neighbour fighting bear
- and there bmight be external params plugged in that channel process thru conditional branching
you figure out how bear can be wresteled out of that eyeball, and the story can change its flow
- for its a space of a process, with all possible timelines present
- but when process runs each time, it can take a different timeline

## phase rotation
those funny double indeces in file extentions
- first is tic sequence
- second is phase of a tic
- tics are not instant, info takes some time to emerge, an effort and an energy
- so the node sits and spins, while it gets a haircut, and is ready for the next tic
- so tic phases are variations o the same patch, or micro developments within space of that patch
- its kinda arbitrary, but so is division of time into space. 
- its totally subjective
- but not entirely, for semantics is a thing, and words have meaning
- and, not to confuse or raise eye .. balls, these phases are what complex numbers are about
- and it all smacks of qm stinking breath
- and of that monster in the closet, quantum gravity, for theres space involved, and its granular, and its quantum

## so lets talk about semver
it all stems from our decision to lock all versions, non of that ^ and ~ nonsense
- we have to be deterministic on deps
- a distributed and self evolving net can not be losely connected in version space
- that has to be crystal clear, with no fuzziness of version hell
- thats a common practice in production software tho, nothing new here

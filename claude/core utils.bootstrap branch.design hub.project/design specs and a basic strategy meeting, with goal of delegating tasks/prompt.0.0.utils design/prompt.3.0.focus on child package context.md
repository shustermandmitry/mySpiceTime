we need to design ONLY packages outlined in the specs

We not designing a test coordination framework right now

we nedd to generate design notes and context for each of child projects where packages will be implemented

as described, each project needs to be aware of overall picture, as its initial perspective

so, there will be a common context doc, that will be passed to each project, and a project specific design doc focused
on exact details of the package being developed by the project

We are establishing API boundaries between packages

They need to be aware about APIs of other packages, but not much about implementation, perhaps in some general sense

## we will not finish entire util design in this chat

- not even close. the complexity is too much, and its a non starter approach, since we are giving up any notion of
  separation of concern

- but that was driven by a dire frustration of having such a narrow perspective from each local design effort, when
  entire network of deps being developed at the same time

- Which is universal pattern, since its just of matter of time scales, as far as same time goes

## Whats the solution to narrow perspective in design of each package, as a standalone entity/package

- It has to be to increase its volume of perspective.
  now, keep in mind, its local perspective, and its not necessarily complete or even right, or consistent with other
  package perspectives
- it is simply an API surface of a given package, in respect to all other packages it percieves are to serve it.
- Each one of those deps is a node in its design perspective.
- The space of these nodes is not necessarily same as
  package structure agreed to at the first meeting, at project design hub
- Project design hub

1. a claude project that spawns its package project nodes,
2. each package project develops its design perspective, with a chat for each node.
3. its not necessarily same as any other package perspective.
4. there might be other packages they are not aware of yet
5. but each is entitled to its opinion

## How do we reconcile all those divergent perspectives

- that is why we have ProjectHub component

NOTE: remarkably, its starting to sound like a project management concern. Perhaps, it is, and the ProjectHub has one
of its lineages in ProjectManagement component, though in a mixin structural pattern, perhaps not direct inheritance

- the children projects , children package design projects, make their perspectives visible upscope, to the
  parent hub
- hub processes, on every change, or within some accumulated window, a threshold, and producers an update on its
  own perspective, the overal design that takes needs of each child into consideration
- it does not change their perspective in place. Thats not polite. It producers an update to his own perspective, as
  another tic in its sequence
- and children get notified that their parent has something to say to them
- they examine new design and it might rub one of them wrong, so it does not accept the change as his own perspective
- that triggers negotiations, and back and forth between all of them, producing variants of the design tic, as in
  design.tic.1.0, design.tic.1.1.adjusted for aggregator request 1.md, design.tic.1.2.adjusted to patcher response 2.md
- note how references to some stored docs are made. nothing is lost and thats how links are created, for each one of
  those docs is a node in design space
- and each such node is categorized by the domains it belongs to, and those domains are defined by type of links
  that connect them to other nodes
  in this case, the links might be 'complain', and 'ridiculous', and the message from aggregator is placed into a
  ridiculous complain bin, and the sender is notified to change its internl design, for its wish is not granted

## How do we implement all these sophisticated perspectives and negotiation processes, before we even created our tools

that would make it even possible

- well, we do it the best we can with tools available

1. we can use our own clever techniques
2. or we can leverage what others done.
3. one tool that might help is project called [Deep](https://github.com/deep-foundation/deep)

- third party tools need to be handled carefully. To maintain our focus and flexibility, we can not explicitely rely on
  any third party tool
  Instead, we should wrap them up in a standard wrapper of GQL schema of the wrapping service and GQL queries and
  mutations from
  our clients
  resolvers might just expose the exact API surface of wrapped package

## This pretty much wraps up how any structure evolves, web dev and beyond

and that structure emergence is the domain of

- first structure-util, which leverages a more simplistic sta-package-util
- while sta-package-util leverages aggregator-util and patcher-util, to generate and implement patches
- what structure util will do is

1. provide domain management, by maintaining and creating domain trees via inheritance
   mechanism of structure building
2. generate 3d perspectives of packages that give idea how components are distributed thru domain spaces,
   for a component can be have mixins from multiple domains, thru mixin composition
3. domains are created thru HOC pattern - the I color
4. 3d spaces are created thru compound component mechanism, creating arrays of possible children for each parent
   component.
   thats the M color of structure
5. then, the seqauntial timelike pattern is the S color.
   and the use of that is not hard to guess. its the historic record of each node development
6. Yes, theres GIT for that, but thats just one tool. This is another complimentary tool, of clear visualization,
   that facilitates reasoning

## Next is Structure component

It leverages structure-util to do same functionality, at runtime, as part of a spicetimeReactApp.
in addition

- it exposes scopes of hierarchial domains and spacetime context of 3+1 spaces each node is associated with
- this provides for a rich suite of apps and functionalities such as this examples

1. visualizations how spicetime regions interact with rigid structures of hierarchial domains that are at the
   core of those 3+1 spaces, for each can be constructed on top of different cores, variants of spicetime structure,
   different versions of STA repo
2. SpicetimeEditor component. It exposes a code editor that injects those scopes and 3+1 perspectives on different
   categories,
   into local environment.
   that allows a seamless integration of all domains and spaces relevant to a node, into globally and temporaly aware
   react components
   facilitating development of spicetime as an evolving process in multiple domains across multiple crosslinked spaces,
   while leveraging historical data and extracting all possible context out os sequential nature of processes involved
3. simply speaking, it will provide a memory for each perspective, to build its reasoning and intellegence in context of
   that memory,
   in a semanticaly comprehencable environment, relavant to each locality
4. and thats enough tom create self aware generative agents, with ease

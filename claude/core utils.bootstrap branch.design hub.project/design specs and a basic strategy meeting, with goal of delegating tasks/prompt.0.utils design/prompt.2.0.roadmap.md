- create a summary of this prompt, that reflects on design of all moving parts we talked about
  the suite of utils we are building, the bigger scope in time and in space of the repol as we start developing
  components
- we will procede to children projects, where each one of the mentioned packages will be developed in parallel, but '
  within its own bounds of focused concerns
- this project will be the hub, the parent project for its chilfren, and this summary will be the initial design and
  context that binds them together
- each project will have its own set of chats dedicated to the packages it cares about, its deps
  but in its own perspective, reflecting its own needs
- we will manually manage the process of reconcillation of those perspectives in a continuous progression of chats in
  the hub projects, as described
- our experience will be the base for adjustments in structure-util and Structure component, and most likely drive
  design of all other utils

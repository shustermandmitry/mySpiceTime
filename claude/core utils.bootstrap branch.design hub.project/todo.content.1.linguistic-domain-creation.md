# Utility Design: Automatic Domain Creation System

## **Overview**
This utility enables **automatic domain creation** by analyzing patterns in user input, detecting semantic relationships, and organizing data into dynamic categories (domains). It adapts to shorthand conventions, provides feedback on clarity and efficiency, and optimizes behavior by clustering input into meaningful, actionable domains.

The system dynamically evolves based on real-world usage, correcting randomness and inconsistencies, and asking clarifications when needed. It facilitates clear communication between users and machines, improving efficiency and scalability.

## **Key Features**
### **1. Automatic Domain Creation**
The system continuously identifies patterns and clusters inputs into self-organizing domains. Domains evolve dynamically over time without requiring predefined schemas.

- **Pattern Recognition:** Analyzes recurring themes, props, and relationships from logs or queries.
- **Props Extraction:** Identifies key variables within domains (e.g., `user ID`, `failure reason`, `amount`).
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Learns to split or merge domains based on usage patterns and scales effortlessly.

### **2. Feedback and Clarity Optimization**
Encourages effective input habits by monitoring clarity and rewarding intentional, structured shorthand while correcting total randomness.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** Suggestions for improving ambiguous logs or queries.
- **Clarity Scoring:** Rates input on structure, intent, and consistency.
- **User Tutorials:** Adapts to common usage patterns and provides personalized guides to reduce sloppiness.

### **3. Cross-Team and Scalable Design**
Handles diverse inputs across teams or departments, aligning varied shorthand styles into unified domains without losing context. Adapts in real time as data complexity grows.

## **Core Design Process**

### Step 1: **Input Analysis**
1. **Pattern Detection:**
    - Identify repetitions, similarities, or semantic links between user inputs.
    - Map frequent logs or queries into thematic clusters (potential domains).
    - Examples:
        - _"Login failed for user 123."_
        - _"Authentication timeout for user A."_
        - Both fall under a common “Authentication” theme.

2. **Variable Extraction:**
    - Extract key props like `user`, `failure reason`, `server`, etc.
    - Define reusable structures around these variables.

3. **Ambiguity Handling:**
    - For unclear or sloppy input, infer meaning where possible.
    - Trigger clarifying follow-ups when patterns are not consistent.

---

### Step 2: **Domain Formation**
1. **Initial Grouping:**
    - Group logs or inputs with similar phrasing, props, or context (semantic affinity).
    - Example Groups:
        - **Authentication Logs:** Failures (password issues, timeouts).
        - **Payment Logs:** Transactions (failures, refunds, successes).
        - **System Errors:** Server issues, operational failures.

2. **Domain Definition:**
    - Establish domains by tagging clustered groups.
    - Track high-level themes and refine toward specific subdomains or props.

3. **Domain Refinement:**
    - Merge overlapping domains or split broader categories into finer-grained subdomains.
    - Continuously improve by adapting to new input patterns.

---

### Step 3: **Learning and Adaptation**
1. **Self-Optimization:**
    - Use AI to refine props and domain definitions based on observed context.
    - Example:
        - Mapping _“auth_fail BAD_PASSWORD”_ → "Invalid Credential Error."
        - Mapping _“timeout error”_ → "Authentication Timeout Issue."

2. **Handling New Patterns:**
    - For new input types, infer relationships to existing domains.
    - Ask for clarification where necessary:
        - _"Does this log belong to the Authentication domain or is it a Payment event?"_

3. **Feedback Loop:**
    - Surface learning insights back to users:
        - _"25% of your logs are ambiguous. Standardizing phrases could improve cost efficiency."_
    - Correct actions and refine input guidelines.

---

### Step 4: **Feedback and Efficiency**
1. **Clarity Feedback:**
    - AI measures input consistency and clarity in real time.
        - Example Issue: Ambiguous Input:
            - _"Login fail."_
            - Suggested Fix: _"Login failed for user ID 123 due to invalid password."_
            - Rating: **Clarity: 60/100. Improve grammar and accuracy for better interpretation.**

2. **Efficiency Report:**
    - Track token usage.
    - Give feedback on how structured logs save costs:
        - Example:
            - _"Optimized log phrasing saved 30% of processing tokens this week."_

3. **Real-Time Tutorials:**
    - Offer context-aware suggestions dynamically:
        - _"You frequently write ‘error server timeout.’ Here’s how to be more specific: ‘Alpha server timed out due to overload at 11:45PM.’"_

---

### Step 5: **Cost Optimization**
1. **Token Cost Tracking:**
    - Monitor how ambiguous or verbose logs consume extra tokens and inflate costs.
    - Provide cost analysis:
        - _"Your input this week consumed $10 worth of processing. Optimized phrasing could save $2."_

2. **Adaptive Input Correction:**
    - Let AI suggest cost-effective phrasing.
        - _"Input: Transaction failed. Replace with: 'Payment of $25 by user 123 failed due to insufficient funds.'"_

3. **Reward System:**
    - Reward efficient users with insights:
        - _"Your clarity improvements this week saved the system 15% processing time."_

---

## **Example Workflow**

### Logs and Queries:
```plaintext
Log A: "Login failed for user 123."
Log B: "Payment $20 declined. Insufficient funds."
Log C: "Timeout occurred during server processing."

New Input:  
"Refund $75 issued to user ID 789."
```

### AI Processing Steps:
1. Analyze content for patterns and props.
    - Log A and Log C fit under the **“Authentication/Errors” domain.**
    - Log B and New Input belong in a **“Payments” domain.**

2. Refine domains:
    - Extract variables like `amount`, `user ID`, `failure reason` dynamically.
    - Translate shorthand: _“Payment declined”_ → "Failed Transaction for insufficient funds."

3. Provide Feedback:
    - If Log A were ambiguous (_"Login failed"_), AI suggests:
        - _"Include details like 'when and why login failed' to avoid extra costs."_

## **Scalable Design Benefits**
1. **Domain Flexibility:** Supports teams writing in diverse shorthand without sacrificing unity or structure.
2. **AI-Driven Refinement:** Domains evolve automatically, saving manual classification effort.
3. **Cost Reduction:** Clear input improves token efficiency and reduces processing costs.
4. **Proactive Tutorials:** Users improve input habits through personalized, actionable insights.

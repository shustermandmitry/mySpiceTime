## prompt
im trying to understand how to leverage deep ij my project
i need to maintain multiple symantic models, perspctives of nodes in a distributed spacetime like architecture
each node has its own perspective on global reality
theres a notion of virtual global space as everything is handled by ipfs with unified addressing 
and its synched between nodes
each node has multiple symantic models, perspectives
for each domain and 
also for any other node in its perspective, as it best perceives that node perspective
simply a limited and fuzzy, delayed by message propagation mirrors of other node perspectives, but also deliberately limited to subjects of interest
i envisioned a patch based  messaging system that would effect synching. Its not a spagetti fre for all, but organized by domains/hierarchies
with tree like propagation in each domain
again, another graph structure that can live in instance of deep

so, i understand deep is reactive and maintaines its symantic structure internally
it would be ok if it maps directly over my idea of message and update p[ropagation]
but i dont know what it does and how to structure and control links in deep

## answer
I'll help you understand how Deep could fit into your distributed semantic architecture. Let me break this down based on your requirements:

[Distributed Semantic Models with Deep](prompt.1.answer.doc.Distributed Semantic Models with Deep.md)

Let me explain how Deep can support your distributed semantic architecture:

1. **Perspective Management**:
- Deep's reactive graph structure allows you to create separate semantic models for each perspective
- Each perspective can be a Deep instance containing its own semantic graph
- Relations between perspectives can be modeled as links in a higher-level Deep instance

2. **Node Perspectives**:
- You can use Deep's type system to model how each node perceives others
- The code shows how to create perceptions of other nodes' perspectives
- Deep's reactive system automatically propagates changes through these perspectives

3. **Domain Hierarchies**:
- Deep's flexible linking system allows modeling domain hierarchies
- You can create tree-like propagation structures using Deep's links
- The example shows how to organize perspectives by domain

4. **Update Propagation**:
- Deep's event system (`deep.on()`) handles reactive updates
- Selections (`deep.select()`) let you track specific types of changes
- The patch-based messaging system can be implemented using Deep's value change events

5. **IPFS Integration**:
- Deep's universal value handling makes it compatible with IPFS addressing
- You can store IPFS CIDs as values in Deep links
- The example includes placeholder IPFS integration points

Key Deep features that align with your needs:

1. **Reactive Updates**:
```typescript
const selection = deep.select({ type: updateType });
selection.on((event) => {
  if (event.name === 'change') {
    // Handle update propagation
  }
});
```

2. **Hierarchical Organization**:
```typescript
const domainHierarchy = types.domain.new();
const childNode = types.node.new();
childNode.from = domainHierarchy; // Establish hierarchy
```

3. **Perspective Tracking**:
```typescript
const perspective = deep.select({
  type: perspectiveType,
  from: sourceNode,
  to: targetNode
});
```

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or show how to implement particular functionality?

## prompt
so, when i update a node in deep, it handles messaging and fires all events using .on method
so is that a subscription model?
i envision a much more sophisticated messaging system
just a subscription model creates a spagetti nightmare with serious performance issues
it needs to be permition based, and adjustable intuitively by users on local level.
Each user is a node, or managers nodes in his org
and they set transparency and focuses and all kinds of stuff we do in normal comms
i want it to be interactive and intuitive

## answer
Let me explain Deep's event system and how you could build your more sophisticated messaging layer on top of it.

[Controlled Message Propagation System](prompt.2.answer.doc.Controlled Message Propagation System.ts)

You're right - Deep's basic `.on()` subscription model is just the foundation. Here's how you can build a more sophisticated system on top of it:

1. **Controlled Propagation**:
- Instead of direct subscriptions, messages go through a MessageController
- Each domain can have its own message queue with delivery rules
- Messages are filtered and batched based on recipient settings

2. **Permission System**:
- Users/nodes can set transparency levels per domain
- Focus areas define what updates they want to receive
- Permissions can be hierarchical (org level, team level, individual)

3. **Interactive Control**:
   You could build a UI where users can:
- Set focus areas for different domains
- Adjust transparency levels
- Define delivery rules and priorities
- See and modify their subscription graph

4. **Performance Optimization**:
- Messages are batched and rate-limited
- Delivery rules prevent unnecessary propagation
- Recipients are filtered before message delivery

The example shows how to:
1. Create users with permission settings
2. Set up focus areas and transparency levels
3. Create domain-specific message queues
4. Add delivery rules for controlled propagation
5. Send messages with custom propagation rules

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect? For example, I could show how to build an interactive UI for managing these settings, or dive deeper into the permission system?

ok
the main advantage here is i could set up a sytem where i can introduce new ideas and tools and layer them up in a midlleware p[ipeline, leveraging deep
i want to isolate that functionality into a deep-pipeleine util

## answer
I'll help you create a utility that lets you build flexible middleware pipelines using Deep's infrastructure.

[Deep Pipeline Utility](prompt.3.answer.script.Deep Pipeline Utility.ts)

The `DeepPipeline` utility I've created provides a flexible way to build processing pipelines while leveraging Deep's capabilities. Here are the key features:

1. **Middleware Architecture**:
- Add/remove processing steps dynamically
- Configure priority levels for ordering
- Conditional execution based on context
- Async processing support

2. **Deep Integration**:
- Each pipeline step is represented in Deep
- Processing state is tracked in the graph
- Results and errors are stored as relationships
- Reactive monitoring of pipeline execution

3. **Features**:
```typescript
// Add middleware with priority and conditions
pipeline.addStep({
  id: 'myStep',
  priority: 100,  // Higher runs first
  condition: (ctx) => ctx.shouldRun,
  process: async (context, next) => {
    // Process data
    return next();
  }
});

// Add monitoring
pipeline.addMonitoring({
  onStepComplete: (stepId, duration) => {...},
  onPipelineComplete: (duration) => {...},
  onError: (error) => {...}
});
```

4. **Benefits**:
- Organized middleware management
- Trackable processing state
- Error handling and monitoring
- Extensible architecture

Would you like me to:
1. Show how to integrate this with the messaging system from earlier?
2. Add specific features for your use case?
3. Demonstrate how to build custom middleware steps?

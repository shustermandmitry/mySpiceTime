## prompt
im not sure if its already there, but i want that pipeline run like a process
it should have conditional branches and take a different timeline depending on environmental inputs, which can come from another deep instance, managed by another pipeline
so we have composable pipelines, each controlling its domain of deep instance
basically, deep instance becomes state of another, with pipeline a react like logic
we could build actual react components of increadable power

## answer
Ah, I see what you're getting at! Let me enhance the pipeline system to support reactive branching and pipeline composition, making it more like a state machine that can interact with other Deep instances.

[Reactive Deep Pipeline System](prompt.4.nswer.script.Reactive Deep Pipeline System.ts)

I've created a more sophisticated system that treats pipelines as reactive state machines that can:

1. **Manage Complex State Flows**:
```typescript
pipeline.addState({
  id: 'processing',
  data: { /* initial state */ },
  process: async (context, environment) => {
    // Process data using environment inputs
  },
  transitions: [
    {
      to: 'success',
      condition: (ctx, env) => ctx.status === 'complete'
    },
    {
      to: 'retry',
      condition: (ctx, env) => env.shouldRetry
    }
  ]
});
```

2. **Connect Multiple Deep Instances**:
```typescript
// Connect another Deep instance as environment
pipeline.connectEnvironment('dataSource', otherDeepInstance);

// Watch for changes
pipeline.watchEnvironment('dataSource', 
  { type: someType },
  (event) => {
    // React to changes in other Deep instance
  }
);
```

3. **React-like Component Model**:
- Pipelines can act as state managers for components
- Components can compose multiple pipelines
- Each pipeline can manage its own Deep instance
- Reactive rendering based on state changes

4. **Environmental Reactivity**:
- Pipelines react to changes in connected Deep instances
- State transitions can be triggered by external events
- Multiple pipelines can coordinate through shared environments

Would you like me to:
1. Show more complex component examples using this system?
2. Demonstrate how to build specific types of reactive behaviors?
3. Add more features for pipeline composition or state management?

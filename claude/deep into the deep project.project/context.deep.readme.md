[📚 API Documentation](./API.md)

## How to Use

Install the package:
```bash
npm install @deep-foundation/deep
# or
yarn add @deep-foundation/deep
```

Import and use in your code:
```javascript
// ESM
import { Deep } from '@deep-foundation/deep';

// CommonJS
const { Deep } = require('@deep-foundation/deep');

// Create a new Deep instance
const deep = new Deep();
```

### Using CLI

You can interact with Deep through its CLI interface:
```bash
npx @deep-foundation/deep --cli
```

Once in the REPL session, you can explore and manipulate your Deep instance. Here's an example of finding and displaying all relations:

```typescript
> const deep = new Deep()
> const allRelations = deep.select({})
> console.log(`Found ${allRelations.size} relations in total`)
> 
> // Display relations grouped by type
> const byType = new Map()
> allRelations.each(rel => {
    const type = rel.type?.value || 'untyped'
    byType.set(type, (byType.get(type) || 0) + 1)
  })
> 
> console.log('\nRelations by type:')
> byType.forEach((count, type) => {
    console.log(`${type}: ${count} relations`)
  })
```

This will show you all relations in your Deep instance, organized by their types.

## Concept

Deep is a universal system for representing and connecting any form of meaning - from basic data types to complex systems and behaviors. Just as our consciousness naturally associates different concepts, sensations, and ideas in a unified space, Deep creates a pure semantic space where everything is interconnected and accessible in a uniform way. It's designed to seamlessly handle any type of data or behavior - whether it's running code across different languages and platforms, managing distributed systems, or synchronizing with various data sources.

At its core, Deep aims to become a universal memory and perception system for both human and artificial intelligence. It provides AI systems with dynamic context mapping and intuitive navigation through semantic space, allowing any AI to perceive and operate on its designated memory region as if it were its own long-term and working memory. This unified approach to memory and perception enables seamless integration between different AI systems, letting them share and process information in a natural, context-aware manner.

In its visual incarnations across desktop, mobile platforms, and extensions, Deep provides a universal perception layer where the space itself and every element within it is an associative link to a React component. These components dynamically reflect various states of the associative memory, seamlessly integrating with Material-UI, Apache ECharts, and numerous other frameworks. This modular approach allows for complete visual customization without modifying the core engine - new visualization capabilities can be added simply by connecting additional dependencies, making Deep's visual representation as flexible as its underlying semantic structure.

### Key Components

The **Deep** class is the core of the system - it represents a universal agent capable of performing operations on any type of data. Each instance of Deep is an active agent that can interact with any other Deep instance or data type through a rich set of methods:

#### Data Operations

All methods work uniformly across different data types, treating single items as collections of one element where the item serves as both key and value. This approach allows for consistent data manipulation regardless of whether you're working with a single item or a collection.

#### Value Methods
- `has(item)` → boolean - Checks if item exists in the collection
- `get(key)` → value - Returns value by key, for single items the key is the item itself
- `set(key, value)` → value - Sets value by key, returns the value
- `unset(key)` → boolean - Removes value by key, returns success status
- `add(value)` → value - Adds value to collection, for single items replaces the value
- `size()` → number - Returns collection size, for single items returns 1 or 0
- `keys()` → Array<any> - Returns array of keys, empty for single items
- `values()` → Array<any> - Returns array of values, for single items returns array with one item
- `map(callback(value, key))` → Array<any> - Maps over collection with callback, returns new array
- `find(callback(value, key))` → any - Returns first item where callback returns true
- `filter(callback(value, key))` → Array<any> - Returns array of items where callback returns true
- `each(callback(value, key))` → void - Iterates over collection with callback
- `reduce(callback(accumulator, value), initial)` → any - Reduces collection to single value
- `sort(callback(a, b))` → Array<any> - Returns sorted array based on callback comparison
- `first()` → any - Returns first item of collection or the item itself for single items
- `last()` → any - Returns last item of collection or the item itself for single items
- `join()` → string - Converts collection to string, for single items calls toString()
- `toString()` → string - Returns string representation
- `valueOf()` → any - Returns primitive value if possible

#### Selection

Selections in Deep are powerful reactive queries that not only retrieve data but also track changes in real-time. They provide a comprehensive event system that propagates changes throughout the semantic graph:

- **Value Change Events**: Track modifications to node values within the selection
- **Selection Events**: Monitor changes in selection contents (additions/removals)
- **Difference Tracking**: Track detailed changes in selections over time
- **Event Propagation**: Events automatically propagate through related selections

Example of tracking value changes in a selection:
```typescript
const Type1 = deep.new();
const instance = Type1.new();

// Create and monitor a selection
const selection = deep.select({ type: Type1 });
selection.on((event) => {
  if (event.name === 'change' && event.field === 'value') {
    console.log('Value changed:', event);
  }
});

// Changes to instance will trigger selection events
instance.value = 'new value';
```

Example of difference tracking:
```typescript
const selection = deep.select({ type: Type1 });
const difference = deep.Difference.call(selection);

// Make some changes
instance1.value = 'test1';
instance2.kill();
const instance3 = Type1.new();

// Get patch of changes
const patch = difference.call();
console.log('Events:', patch.call.events.length);
console.log('Added:', patch.call.added.length);
console.log('Updated:', patch.call.updated.length);
console.log('Removed:', patch.call.removed.length);
```

- `select(expression)` → Selection - Creates a reactive selection of links based on expression
    - Expression is an object that can contain the following keys, where each key's value can be either another expression object or a Deep instance:
        - Direct selectors:
            - [x] `type` - Filter links by type
            - [x] `from` - Filter links by source node
            - [x] `to` - Filter links by target node
            - [x] `id` - Filter links by id
            - [x] `value` - Filter links by value
        - Reverse selectors:
            - [x] `typed` - Filter links where they have this as their type
            - [x] `out` - Filter links where they have this as their from
            - [x] `in` - Filter links where they have this as their to
            - [x] `valued` - Filter links where they have this as their value
        - Logic operators:
            - [x] `not` - Exclude links matching the expression
            - [x] `and` - Include links matching all expressions
            - [x] `or` - Include links matching any expression (must be an array where each item can be an expression object or a Deep instance)
        - Conditions (comparison operators):
            - [ ] `eq` - Equal to
            - [ ] `neq` - Not equal to
            - [ ] `gt` - Greater than
            - [ ] `lt` - Less than
            - [ ] `gte` - Greater than or equal to
            - [ ] `lte` - Less than or equal to
            - [ ] `in` - Value is in array
            - [ ] `nin` - Value is not in array
    - Selection is reactive - automatically updates when matching links change
    - Returns a Selection instance that contains matching links
    - Examples:
      ```typescript
      // Direct (One to one) relations
      const linkType = someLink.type // returns Deep instance or undefined
      const linkFrom = someLink.from // returns Deep instance or undefined
      const linkTo = someLink.to // returns Deep instance or undefined
      const linkValue = someLink.value // returns Deep instance or JS primitive
  
      // Reverse (One to many) relations
      const linksOfThisType = someLink.typed.call() // get all links that use this as their type
      const linksFromThis = someLink.out.call() // get all links that start from this
      const linksToThis = someLink.in.call() // get all links that point to this
      const linksWithThisValue = someLink.valued.call() // get all links that have this as value
  
      // Complex query combining both types of relations
      const complexQuery = deep.select({
        and: [
          { type: someType }, // direct relation
          { not: { in: someTarget }}, // exclude links pointing to someTarget (reverse relation)
          { valued: someValue } // include links having someValue (reverse relation)
        ]
      })
      complexQuery.call() // returns Deep instance with multiple results
      ```

#### Modify (Coming Soon)
- `insert({ type, from, to, value })` → Deep - Creates new link
- `update({ type?, from?, to?, value? })` → Deep - Updates existing link
- `delete()` → boolean - Removes link

### Relations

Relations in Deep allow you to create complex interconnected structures. Here's an example with types A, B, C and their instances:

```typescript
// Define types
const A = deep.new();
const B = deep.new();
const C = deep.new();

// Create instances
const a1 = A.new();
const b1 = B.new();
const c1 = C.new();

// (If we create a1,b1,c1 from deep.new(), not from A,B,C.new()), type can be setted manually:
// a1.type = A;  // a1 is of type A
// b1.type = B;  // b1 is of type B
// c1.type = C;  // c1 is of type C

// Create relationships
a1.from = b1;  // a1 points from b1
b1.to = c1;    // b1 points to c1
c1.from = a1;  // c1 points from a1

// Direct traversals
a1.type;   // → A (get type of a1)
a1.from;   // → b1 (get source node)
a1.to;     // → undefined (no target node)
a1.typed;  // → [a1] (get all instances of same type)
a1.out;    // → [c1] (get all outgoing connections)
a1.in;     // → [b1] (get all incoming connections)

// Multiple traversals
// You can chain traversals to navigate through the graph
a1.out;         // → [c1] (get outgoing connections)
a1.out.tos;     // → [] (get 'to' nodes of outgoing connections)
a1.out.froms;   // → [a1] (get 'from' nodes of outgoing connections)
a1.out.types;   // → [C] (get types of outgoing connections)

// Complex traversal example
// Get all nodes that are targets of our outgoing connections
// and then get their outgoing connections
a1.out.call.forEach(node => {
  console.log(node.out.call); // show outgoing connections of each node
});
```

In this example:
- We have three types: A, B, C
- Instances a1, b1, c1 form a triangle of relationships
- We can traverse these relationships using direct properties (type, from, to, etc.)
- We can perform multiple traversals by chaining operations
- Each traversal returns a Deep instance that can be further queried

### Association in Deep

An association (link) consists of the following components:
- **type** - link type (also a Deep)
- **from** - link source (Deep)
- **to** - link target (Deep)
- **value** - link value (can be any data type)

When creating associations in Deep, there are several important patterns to understand:

#### Creating Associations from Other Associations

When you create a new association using the `.new()` method from an existing association:
1. The association you're calling `.new()` from becomes the type of the new association
2. The optional argument passed to `.new()` becomes the value of the new association
3. For primitive JavaScript values (strings, numbers, booleans), the value is automatically wrapped in a special container for deduplication

Example:
```typescript
const Type = deep.new();
const instance1 = Type.new('value1'); // Creates new association with Type as type and wrapped 'value1' as value
const instance2 = Type.new('value1'); // Reuses the same wrapped value due to deduplication
console.log(instance1.value); // Deep with .value == 'value1'
console.log(instance1.value === instance2.value); // true - same wrapped value reference
console.log(instance1.call, 'value1'); // true - возвращает конечное значение
```

This pattern enables:
- Type-safe association creation
- Automatic value deduplication
- Memory optimization for primitive values
- Consistent handling of values across the system

### Uniform Data Handling

A key feature of Deep is its uniform approach to handling both single items and collections:
- When working with a single item, it's treated as a collection of one element where the item serves as both key and value
- The same methods work consistently across different data types (Symbol, Promise, Boolean, String, Number, BigInt, Set, Map, Array, Object, Function)
- This uniformity allows for seamless transitions between single and multiple data operations

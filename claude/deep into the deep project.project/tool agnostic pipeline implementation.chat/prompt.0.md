## prompt
note the convo with kostya i just attached

it covers much more then subject of this chat

which is

making pipeline implementation, in its basic form, agnostic of the tool, TreeRPC or Deep

it should present a declarative schema similar to gql schema, but no heavy machinery of GQL

its an internal util, or a component
this component name is Process
just like explained in last part of the convo with kostya, thats the use case, to overlay organizational process on org spacetime
notice spacetime. It will operate on past present and future of the org, by making predictions and managing and learning from the past, and operating calendars, and making long range plans
its a composable process, built in a build window by composing a functional structure, and using another domain/space/jsx string as its state, 
so processes can be composed in several ways
- by combining two states into one
that state can come from anywhere, just a prop. it can be another domain or jsx string or the domain(a deep instance) the pipe is operating on
- by passing operational graph as context/state of another process/pipeline
- by combining operational graphs together 

but its always some combo of all three, and that is a hirerachy by itself, process composition rules/components, that take processes and compose them, basically allowing to compose process 
types into other types, and hydrated with real life cases of organizational profile, but thats way in the future, but a nice roadmap goal

so, we are designing abasic pipeline implementation that can take plugins in form of extending its own process tree, to add functionality to itself
the basic pipe will just execute its pipeline, detect loops by very simple mechanism wity minimal overhead, and terminate transaction if any problem
nothing else, not even logging
yes, it should throw with full context reported, but leave more complex logging to plugins
same for all fancy variants we identified before
those are just plugins
so is tool used, deep or treerpc or anything else
however, it will expose a schema, not a gql schema, but a lightweight equivalent
and resolvers will install themselves as pipeline elements
actually, the resolver tree should just be added to the process tree
as explained to kostya, we will build pipes by manipulating functional lexical trees
so, the schema is just a condensed or abstracted version of the tree, not as granular and leafy as the pipe itself, just a skeleton
- the queries are monitoring and reporting links
- mutations are mutations on itself
- but it has to go thru a webdev cycle to implemet it
- webdev stages are part of every pipeline/process
- -when they merge, the webdev part stays intact. its immutable

but the schema of of the pipeline util, the scripot that implements this design and runs the pipeline, is a different schema
it will allow plugins the engine, deep or treerpc, thru its resolvers, and will become attached to every pipeline
so, webdev process is part of it, an immutable part of any process
the process executes one branch or another according to the state. its like genes in dna get activated by environment
the lexical structure of the tree is a structure of all possible ways to go thru process. 
for example, a receipe might be entered as switch/to/designMode/interact/with/user/fix/problems/test/switch/back/to/productionMode
and guess what happens

as explained, 
- we want a familiar pattern of redux, but with extended capabiloity of multiple domains/routers of operation
a pipeline for each subrouter
- separate state for each pipeline
- we will do composition in a different place, just like redux does not exactly provides a native way to compose reducers
- maybe it does in some versions, but its just a bolt on functionality
- its domains are bound by the app, as routers within it
- but state and routers can be combined with other remote nodes by extending their their routers, and synching the jsx strings and states with remote nodes
- not an exact copy, but we never know exactly what other person perspective is, do we

## prompt 1
we need redux like api surface, in form of a verifiable executable schema

you counting number of steps processed in the queu

thats wrong, theres no limit on that

the limit is on depth of regression, when our side effects trigger another action, and another pipeline to get executed

thats what we detecting, in the base class, then we detect loops in the child classes

so, thats no overhead, but a proper way of detection, not this heck geto job you presented

## answer
Understood - let me revise the implementation to focus on proper recursion depth tracking and provide a Redux-like schema API.



Key changes in this revision:

1. **Proper Recursion Tracking**:
- Tracks recursion depth rather than step count
- Maintains action stack for cycle detection
- Throws meaningful errors with action trace

2. **Redux-like API**:
- Familiar dispatch/reducer pattern
- State management aligned with Redux patterns
- Action-based mutations

3. **Executable Schema**:
- Defines queries and mutations with resolvers
- Schema validation
- Type-safe execution of queries/mutations

4. **Minimal Overhead**:
- Only tracks necessary recursion metrics
- No unnecessary step counting
- Efficient cycle detection via action stack

The base class now focuses on handling recursion depth and action cycles while providing a familiar Redux-like API surface. Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or make additional adjustments?

## prompt 2
lets split plugins and util into separate files

- [Core Process Implementation](prompt.0.answer.script.Core Process Implementation.ts)
- [Process Type Definitions](prompt.0.answer.script.Process Type Definitions.ts)
- [Process Plugin Interface](prompt.0.answer.script.Process Plugin Interface.ts)
- [Backend Plugin Implementations](prompt.0.answer.script.Backend Plugin Implementations.ts)

## answer
I'll split the implementation into separate files for better organization.



I've split the implementation into four main files:

1. **process-core.ts**
- Main Process class implementation
- Core Redux-like functionality
- Schema handling
- Plugin management

2. **process-types.ts**
- Type definitions for Actions, Reducers, Schema
- Shared interfaces used across the system

3. **process-plugin.ts**
- Plugin interface definition
- Lifecycle hooks for plugins

4. **backend-plugins.ts**
- Deep backend implementation
- TreeRPC backend implementation
- Concrete plugin implementations

This structure provides better separation of concerns and makes it easier to:
- Add new plugins
- Modify core functionality independently
- Share types across the system
- Test individual components

Would you like me to adjust anything about this organization or add any additional functionality?

## prompt 3
lets do time quantization plugin, to solve time loops, and make mr einshtein happy
thats how we keep space causal, by extending present, till things get done. and not doing cause before effect
theres a universal speed limit, you know, nothing gets done instantly, so be nice, sit down and mind our construction project

and we do it by inserting a delay into the pipe at the right place where it hurts, and that delay is simply deferal till next cycle of js runtime

## answer 
Ah, I understand - we need a quantum scheduler plugin that manages time-based cycles by deferring actions to the next event loop cycle when needed. This is a nice way to handle temporal causality in the pipeline.

[Quantum Scheduler Plugin](prompt.0.answer.script.Quantum Scheduler Plugin.ts)

The QuantumSchedulerPlugin introduces time quantization to handle causality in the pipeline. Key features:

1. **Time Quantization**:
- Divides time into discrete quanta (default 16ms, roughly one frame)
- Defers cyclic actions to next quantum instead of failing
- Maintains causal ordering of actions

2. **Deferred Action Management**:
- Tracks deferred actions and their attempts
- Processes deferred actions in priority order
- Prevents infinite deferrals with max attempts

3. **Cycle Resolution**:
- Instead of failing on cycles, defers to next quantum
- Gives time for system state to stabilize
- Maintains causality while allowing cycles to resolve

4. **Minimal Overhead**:
- Only activates on cycle detection
- Uses setTimeout for quantum clock
- Efficient tracking of deferred actions

This solves temporal causality by:
- Giving the system time to stabilize between related actions
- Ensuring cause comes before effect by deferring conflicting actions
- Allowing cycles to resolve naturally over time instead of failing immediately

Would you like me to add any additional features or explain any part in more detail?
## prompt 4
why setTimeout

just wondering, perhaps you right

can we just defer to next cycle

if we came to same place in same timeline at next cycle, refer it again

is there any additional overhead to such small graining of time

also we need a promise resoluition block, so we wait till conditions are met

i guess we need all bells and whistles of a real programming lingo, to run our processes, in form of standard lexical elements, like do and dont and with and when and remember

and we will compose english instead of some weird script in the cript

## answer

## prompt 5
i want api where you enter english sentencers, describing the process, and it gets implemented as a functional tree, using either treerps or deep, thru the generec resolvers

a process is a functional tree, with entry points of chjildren nodes in first level

top level is process title, and goes like myprocess kill my dog, and the dog dies on the browser window

so kill is a child

or we can shrten and generalize tree

myProcess->dog

kill and my are lingo keywords. no need to spell all possible verbs every tree level. except when a set of actions must be limited, like in permition situation. we can have inclusion and exclusion patterns, like dont kill and be nice, as gateway phrases

you see how structure would make explicit definitions of processes and all possible timelines in it and all prohibited ones

but the best way to implement it is with a languageBuilder plugin

based on ast parsing and leveraging some custom interpreter building tool

again. we dont care what tool, just give me a schema of structured resolvers that plugin at the top of a tree as a filter before first level of dogs and cats that are to be killed or spared, depending on what that bgeek decides

## answer

# prompt 6
wait

there no shorthand myProcess->dog thats non sensical

theres myProcess dont kill my dog and ,thogh dont and my are not in the structure, the interpreter fills them in for it understands them as keywords, if placed in the lexically correct places a phrase myProcess dog my kill will make him give you a middle finger and throw an error, or ask for clarification

a phrase like myProcess dog kill me will cause it to say, sorry, im not killing you

cos its got a gateway filter that says, dogs dont kill me, or just, be nice to me

yeah, it takes an ai perhaps, bjut parsing into ast embedding would help a lot, and interpreter would handle most and ai would handle the rest, but thats another concern, 
we just install a blackbox structure that takes phrases as paths and spits out filtered phrases that might activate an error handling 
response, but all possibilities are expressed in the structure, and black box just manipulates language, like youi do, and the functional 
structure gives it generative power, and peforms side effects

so basically, a process definition is an essay, grammatically accurate, and properly structured, and ai powered interpreter interprets it at run time and generates a functinal lexical chain out of known kewords and vocabularly.
dog has some functional meaning. its a const that maps to a node in state/tree/context/spicetime

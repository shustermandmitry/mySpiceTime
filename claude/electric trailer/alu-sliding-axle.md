# Aluminum Channel Sliding Axle System
## Revised Design for 200lb Tongue Weight Limit

### 1. Frame Components

#### Main Track System
- Material: 80/20 or similar aluminum extrusion
- Primary rail: 40x80mm profile (~$12/ft)
- Secondary support: 40x40mm profile (~$8/ft)
- Required length: 36" for 24" of travel
- Load rating: 800lb per rail (sufficient with dual rails)

**Base Track Costs:**
- 40x80mm rail (3ft): $36
- 40x40mm support (6ft total): $48
- End caps and mounting brackets: $25
- Fasteners: $15
- Subtotal: $124

#### Sliding Mechanism
- Double V-groove wheels (8 required)
- Zinc-plated steel brackets
- Sealed bearings
- Anti-vibration mounts

**Sliding Assembly Costs:**
- V-groove wheels with bearings (8x $8): $64
- Mounting brackets (4x $6): $24
- Hardware kit: $18
- Subtotal: $106

### 2. Quick Release System

#### Simplified Pin Design
- 1/2" steel locking pins
- Spring-loaded mechanism
- Single-handle operation
- Position detents every 1"

**Quick Release Costs:**
- Steel pins and springs: $25
- Handle assembly: $35
- Position markers: $15
- Hardware: $10
- Subtotal: $85

### 3. Axle Mount

#### Modified for Aluminum Channel
- Aluminum mounting plate: 3/8" thick
- Integrated wheel mounts
- Reinforced spring perches
- Grade 8 mounting hardware

**Axle Mount Costs:**
- Aluminum plate and fabrication: $85
- Spring perches: $45
- Mounting hardware: $25
- Subtotal: $155

### 4. Weight Considerations

**Total System Weight:**
- Track system: ~25lb
- Sliding mechanism: ~15lb
- Axle mount: ~20lb
- Hardware: ~5lb
- Total added weight: ~65lb

### 5. Adjustment Capabilities
- Travel range: 24 inches
- Position locks: Every 1 inch
- Tongue weight adjustment: ~8lb per inch of travel
- Total range: 0-200lb tongue weight

### 6. Total System Cost

**Basic Manual System:**
- Track Components: $124
- Sliding Mechanism: $106
- Quick Release: $85
- Axle Mount: $155
- Total: $470

### 7. Optional Automation Add-On
(If desired later)
- 24V DC gear motor: $125
- Basic controller: $45
- Limit switches: $15
- Hardware: $25
- Total Automation Add-on: $210

### 8. Key Advantages of Revised Design
1. Significantly lower cost
2. Lighter weight
3. Easier to modify/adjust
4. Standard aluminum extrusion allows for easy additions/modifications
5. Parts widely available
6. Simpler maintenance
7. Better corrosion resistance

### 9. Maintenance Notes
- Clean tracks monthly
- Lubricate wheels quarterly
- Check pin alignment every 6 months
- Inspect mounting bolts quarterly

This system is much more cost-effective while still maintaining the functionality you need. The aluminum extrusion system makes it easy to modify or add features later.

Would you like me to:
1. Provide specific aluminum extrusion part numbers?
2. Detail the wheel mounting design?
3. Show the locking mechanism in more detail?
4. Create a detailed assembly diagram?

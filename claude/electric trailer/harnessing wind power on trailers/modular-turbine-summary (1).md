# Modular Wind Turbine System for Camping Trailer

## Core Concept
A modular wind turbine system integrated into the top leading edge of a lightweight camping trailer, designed to harvest wind energy during highway travel to assist with trailer propulsion and provide power for amenities.

## System Specifications

### Base Platform
- Trailer Width: 7 feet
- Installation Height: Top leading edge, approx. 8.5 feet from ground
- Module Slots: 3 positions across width
- Module Width: 2.3 feet (1/3 of trailer width)
- Module Height: 3 feet

### Single Module Specifications
- Type: Ducted cross-flow turbine
- Expected Power Output: 4-6kW at 65mph
- Weight: 30-35kg
- Dimensions: 2.3' × 3' × depth TBD
- Cost Range: $800-1200 per module

### Mounting System
- Full-width mounting rail system
- Three identical mounting positions with:
  - Standardized power connections
  - Quick-release mechanical fasteners
  - Weather-sealed when unused
  - Built-in vibration isolation
  - Load distribution into trailer frame

### Control Integration
- Arduino-based control system
- Tongue load sensor for propulsion assist
- Integration with regenerative hub motor braking
- Modular power management system

## Key Benefits
1. Scalable implementation
2. Lower initial investment
3. Easy maintenance access
4. Simple module replacement/upgrade
5. Fail-soft capability (system remains functional if one module fails)
6. Ability to optimize based on real-world performance

## Primary Uses
1. Trailer propulsion assistance
2. Regenerative braking support
3. Campsite power supply
4. Battery charging during travel

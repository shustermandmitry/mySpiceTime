# SpiceTime Code Assistant Development Roadmap

## Project Abstract
SpiceTime Code Assistant is an extensible IDE assistance system with persistent development context and multi-AI provider support. Unlike traditional AI assistants, it maintains continuous project context and relationships between different codebases, starting with local implementations that can scale to team usage without architectural changes.

## Long-Term Vision
The project will evolve into a comprehensive development ecosystem with ratings, monetary systems, and measurable metrics for contribution value. However, the current scope is intentionally limited to essential developer needs. As more developers join the project, they will have the opportunity to expand the ecosystem, starting with implementing the monetary system to enable fair compensation for contributions. This organic growth approach ensures that features are added by those who will directly benefit from and maintain them.

## Current Scope
- Single developer focus
- Essential project management
- Basic context tracking
- Local-first implementation
- Extendable foundation

## Core Features
- Persistent development context across sessions
- Local graph and vector databases (extensible to distributed)
- Multiple AI provider support
- Project relationship tracking
- Context evolution management

## Development Streams

### 1. spicetime-project-management (PRIORITY)
**Purpose**: Track development progress and maintain context

**Initial Context Required**:
- Project status tracking
- Development context management
- Milestone tracking
- Decision recording

**Key Artifacts**:
- Project status schemas
- Context management types
- Progress tracking interfaces
- Local storage structure

[Previous streams remain the same...]

## Development Approach
1. Start with project management
2. Focus on single developer needs
3. Build extendable foundations
4. Document evolution points
5. Enable future monetization

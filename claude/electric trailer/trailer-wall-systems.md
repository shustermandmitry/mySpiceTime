## VI. ASSEMBLY NOTES

1. FRP Installation
   - Cut with circular saw, fine tooth blade
   - Pre-drill all rivet holes
   - Apply adhesive in S-pattern
   - Install rivets while adhesive is wet

2. Window Installation
   - Frame assembles before installation
   - Install outer pane first
   - Seal all joints
   - Test for water tightness

3. Door Mounting
   - Shim for proper alignment
   - Adjust hinges as needed
   - Test lock operation before final mounting

4. Motor Mount Installation
   - Align carefully for proper tracking
   - Use thread locker on all fasteners

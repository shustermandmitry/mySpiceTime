# Kombucha Brewing Guide with pH Testing

## Initial 1-Gallon Batch Recipe

- 2 tablespoons loose black tea
- 1 cup powdered white sugar
- 2 cups starter kombucha
- 1 SCOBY
- Dechlorinated water to fill to 1 gallon
- pH strips (range 0-6)

## First Fermentation Process

1. Brew tea with 4 cups hot water and tea leaves for 3-5 minutes
2. Remove tea leaves, stir in sugar until dissolved
3. Add remaining cool water to reach room temperature
4. Pour into fermentation container
5. Add starter liquid
6. Test pH - should be between 4.5-5.0 at start
7. Gently place SCOBY
8. Cover with cheesecloth, secure
9. Place in dark spot at 68-78°F (20-26°C)

## pH Testing Schedule & Guidelines

- Day 1: pH 4.5-5.0 (starting pH)
- Day 3: Test pH - should be dropping
- Day 5: Test pH - target 3.5-4.0
- Final pH for drinking: 2.5-3.5
- Hotel pH: maintain at 2.5-3.0

Safety Note: If pH is above 4.0 after 3 days, add more starter liquid

## When First Batch is Ready (Day 5-7)

### Preparation

1. Clean all containers and tools
2. Gather:
    - Hotel jar
    - New brewing container
    - pH strips
    - Drinking bottles
    - Cheesecloth pieces

### Distribution Process

1. Test final pH (should be 2.5-3.5)
2. Remove SCOBYs, separate layers in clean bowl
3. Distribute liquid:
    - 2 cups for next batch
    - 2 cups for SCOBY hotel
    - Remainder for drinking

### Setting Up SCOBY Hotel

1. Pour 2 cups strong kombucha (pH 2.5-3.0) into hotel jar
2. Add one healthy SCOBY layer
3. Cover with cheesecloth
4. Store at room temperature
5. Test pH monthly - maintain at 2.5-3.0

### Starting Next Batch

1. Brew fresh sweet tea:
    - 2 tablespoons loose black tea
    - 1 cup sugar
    - Cool completely
2. Add 2 cups starter liquid
3. Test pH (should be 4.5-5.0)
4. Add SCOBY
5. Cover with cheesecloth

## Continuous Brewing Cycle

1. Every 5-7 days:
    - Test pH (target 2.5-3.5)
    - Reserve 2 cups for next batch
    - Bottle remainder
    - Start new batch
2. Every 4-6 weeks:
    - Test hotel pH
    - Refresh hotel if pH below 2.5
    - Check SCOBY health

## Troubleshooting by pH

- pH too high (>4.0 after 3 days):
    * Add more starter liquid
    * Check temperature
    * Ensure tea was cool when SCOBY added
- pH too low (<2.5):
    * Fermentation too long
    * Temperature too high
    * Ready to bottle
- pH won't drop:
    * SCOBY may be inactive
    * Temperature too low
    * Not enough starter liquid

## Signs of Healthy Fermentation

- pH dropping steadily
- New SCOBY forming on top
- Tea becoming less sweet
- Slightly vinegar smell
- No mold (fuzzy spots)
- SCOBYs cream/tan colored

## Maintenance Schedule

- Daily: Check temperature
- Day 3: First pH test
- Day 5: pH test, taste test
- Day 7: Final pH test if not ready on day 5
- Monthly: Hotel maintenance and pH test
- Every 2 months: Deep clean all equipment

Remember: Always use clean tools, test pH before drinking, and maintain good records of your readings.

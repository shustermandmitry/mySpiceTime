- Clean cloth for wiping jar rim

## Ingredients

### Main Vegetable Components

- 1 large napa cabbage (4-5 lbs)
- 1/2 cup coarse sea salt (for initial salting)
- 1 medium daikon radish (about 1 lb)

- 1.5 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1/4 cup water (if needed for paste consistency)

## Process

### Day 1: Preparation

#### Cabbage Preparation (2-3 hours)

1. Cut cabbage lengthwise into quarters
2. Cut each quarter into 2-inch pieces
3. Salt process:
    - Place cabbage in large bowl
    - Sprinkle 1/2 cup salt, focusing between leaves
    - Gently massage salt into cabbage
    - Let stand 2 hours, turning every 30 minutes
    - Cabbage should be wilted and reduced in volume

#### Vegetable Preparation

While cabbage is salting:

1. Julienne daikon into matchsticks (2-inch length)
2. Julienne carrots same size as daikon
3. Chop green onions into 1-inch pieces
4. Finely mince onion
5. Mince garlic and grate ginger

#### Seasoning Paste

1. In a bowl, combine:
    - Gochugaru
    - Minced garlic
    - Grated ginger
    - Salted scallops (finely chopped)
    - Fish sauce
    - Sugar
2. Mix well to form a paste
3. Add water if needed for spreadable consistency

#### Final Assembly

1. Rinse salted cabbage 3 times in cold water
2. Drain thoroughly (30 minutes in colander)
3. In large bowl, combine:
    - Drained cabbage
    - Prepared vegetables
    - Seasoning paste
4. Mix thoroughly with gloved hands
5. Taste test - should be noticeably salty with balanced flavors

### Initial Fermentation Setup

1. Pack mixture into container:
    - Add in layers, pressing down firmly
    - Leave 2 inches headspace
    - Press to remove air bubbles
2. Place press on top
3. Wipe rim and sides clean
4. Cover loosely to allow gas escape

## Fermentation Timeline

### Days 1-5: Active Fermentation

- Keep at room temperature (65-75Â°F)
- Check daily for:
    - Bubbling activity
    - Pressing down if risen
    - Brine level
    - Aroma development

### Fermentation Stages & Signs

1. Day 1: Light fresh smell, still raw
2. Day 2: Bubbling begins, slight sour smell
3. Day 3: Active bubbling, tangier aroma
4. Day 4-5: Bubbling slows, complex aroma develops

### When to Refrigerate

- Taste test daily starting day 3
- Ready when:
    - Pleasantly sour
    - Vegetables are tender but still crisp
    - Flavors are balanced
    - Usually day 4-5 at room temperature

## Storage & Maintenance

- Transfer to refrigerator when desired sourness reached
- Keeps 3-6 months refrigerated
- Flavors continue developing slowly
- Always use clean utensils
- Press vegetables below brine level

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Too salty:
    - Let ferment longer
    - Serve with plain rice

2. Not fermenting:
    - Check temperature (might be too cold)
    - Ensure vegetables are below brine
    - Give more time

3. Surface yeast (white film):
    - Normal, skim off
    - Press vegetables down more frequently

4. Off smells:
    - If rotting smell, discard
    - If yeasty, normal, continue fermenting

## Tips for Success

- Use fresh, high-quality ingredients
- Maintain consistent temperature
- Keep vegetables submerged
- Handle with clean utensils
- Trust your nose - kimchi should smell pleasant
- Refrigerate when you like the taste

Remember: Each batch is unique and fermentation times may vary. Trust your senses and adjust future batches based on
your preferences.

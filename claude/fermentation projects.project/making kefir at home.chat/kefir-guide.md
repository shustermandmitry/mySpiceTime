# Milk Kefir Making Guide: From Starter to Daily Production

## Initial Activation Phase (Days 1-4)

### Equipment Needed

- Clean glass jars (1-2 cups capacity for starting)
- Plastic strainer
- Coffee filter or breathable cloth
- Rubber band
- Plastic spoon
- Larger jars for scaling up

### Starting Your Grains (First 4 Cycles)

1. Day 1:
    - Pour 1 cup of room temperature milk into a clean glass jar
    - Add your teaspoon of starter grains
    - Cover with coffee filter/cloth and secure with rubber band
    - Let sit at room temperature (68-75°F/20-24°C) for 24 hours

2. Days 2-4:
    - Strain kefir through plastic strainer into a bowl
    - Transfer grains to fresh cup of milk
    - Repeat process daily
    - Each batch during this period is safe to consume but may be milder

## Scaling Up Phase (Days 5-10)

### When Grains Show These Signs of Health:

- Kefir thickens consistently within 24 hours
- Pleasant sour smell develops
- Grains look plump and may be multiplying

### Gradual Increase Process

1. Days 5-6:
    - Increase to 1.5 cups milk
    - Continue 24-hour fermentation

2. Days 7-8:
    - Increase to 2 cups milk if fermentation is consistent
    - Watch for proper thickening

3. Days 9-10:
    - Can increase to 3 cups if grains have multiplied
    - Maintain roughly 1 tablespoon grains per cup of milk ratio

## Established Daily Production (Day 11+)

### Regular Process

1. Morning:
    - Strain previous day's kefir
    - Transfer grains to fresh milk
    - Store finished kefir in refrigerator

2. Throughout day:
    - Keep fermenting batch at room temperature
    - Watch for signs of separation (clear whey at bottom)
    - Ideal fermentation shows thickening but not full separation

### Maintenance Tips

- Clean jars between uses with hot water (no soap)
- Keep grains away from metal
- If grains multiply too much, share extras or reduce ratio
- Store unused grains in milk in refrigerator (up to 2 weeks)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Too slow: Increase room temperature slightly
- Too fast: Reduce temperature or add more milk
- Yeasty smell: Reduce fermentation time
- Separation: Normal, but strain sooner next time
- Grainy texture: Shake or stir before consuming

### When to Start Over

- Grains turn mushy or dissolve
- Pink or orange coloring appears
- Off-putting or rotten smell develops

## Recipe Scaling Guidelines

For larger batches:

- Maintain 1:7 ratio of grains to milk by volume
- Example: 2 tablespoons grains = 2 cups milk
- Maximum recommended batch: 4 cups per jar
- Use multiple jars for larger production

## Storage & Breaks

### Short Break (1-2 weeks):

- Store grains in fresh milk in refrigerator
- Change milk weekly

### Long Break (2+ weeks):

- Dehydrate grains
- Store in airtight container
- Reactivate using initial process

Remember: Consistency is key - try to strain and feed your grains at approximately the same time each day for best
results.

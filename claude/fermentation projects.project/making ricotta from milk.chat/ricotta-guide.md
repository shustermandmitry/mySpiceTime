# Homemade Ricotta Making Guide

## Equipment Needed

- Large heavy-bottomed pot (4+ quart capacity)
- Thermometer (capable of reading 185°F/85°C)
- Large colander
- Cheesecloth or clean cotton kitchen towel
- Long spoon for stirring
- Slotted spoon or ladle
- Large bowl (for catching whey)
- Measuring cups and spoons

## Ingredients for 1 Gallon Batch

- 1 gallon whole milk (not ultra-pasteurized)
- 1/4 cup acid (choose one):
    - Fresh lemon juice (about 2-3 lemons)
    - White vinegar
    - Citric acid (1.5 teaspoons dissolved in 1/4 cup water)
- 1 teaspoon salt (optional)

## Process

### Preparation (5 minutes)

1. Set up draining station:
    - Place colander in large bowl
    - Line colander with 2 layers of cheesecloth
    - Ensure 3-4 inches clearance under colander for whey
2. Measure out acid choice
3. Have thermometer ready

### Heating Phase (15-20 minutes)

1. Pour milk into large pot
2. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally
3. Monitor temperature closely at 170°F (77°C)
4. When temperature reaches 185°F (85°C):
    - Remove from heat
    - Add acid immediately
    - Stir gently 2-3 times

### Curdling Phase (10 minutes)

1. After adding acid:
    - Do not stir
    - Let sit undisturbed for 10 minutes
    - Look for clear separation between curds and whey
2. Signs of proper curdling:
    - White curds floating on top
    - Clear, yellowish whey below
    - Distinct separation between layers

### Draining Phase (10-30 minutes)

1. Gently ladle curds into lined colander
2. Let drain based on desired consistency:
    - 10 minutes: Very soft, spreadable
    - 20 minutes: Medium, traditional consistency
    - 30 minutes: Firmer, dryer texture
3. Optional: Add salt after draining

## Storage & Yield

- Yield: Approximately 2 cups ricotta
- Storage container: Airtight container
- Refrigeration: Up to 5 days
- Do not freeze

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Milk won't curdle:
    - Milk is ultra-pasteurized
    - Temperature not high enough
    - Not enough acid
      Solution: Add more acid 1 tablespoon at a time

2. Curds too fine:
    - Temperature too high
    - Too much stirring
      Solution: Use gentler stirring next time

3. Ricotta too dry:
    - Over-drained
      Solution: Stir in a bit of reserved whey

4. Ricotta too wet:
    - Under-drained
      Solution: Continue draining

## Using the Whey

- Don't discard the whey! Uses include:
    - Bread making (replace water)
    - Soup stock base
    - Plant fertilizer
    - Smoothie addition
    - Pet food supplement

## Tips for Best Results

- Use whole milk for richest results
- Avoid ultra-pasteurized milk
- Don't rush the heating process
- Minimal stirring after adding acid
- Save whey for other uses
- Clean equipment thoroughly after use

## Recipe Variations

1. Richer version:
    - Add 1 cup heavy cream to gallon of milk
    - Proceed as normal

2. Herbs and flavors (add after draining):
    - Fresh herbs: basil, thyme, rosemary
    - Black pepper
    - Lemon zest
    - Olive oil drizzle

Remember: Temperature control and minimal agitation are key to successful ricotta making.

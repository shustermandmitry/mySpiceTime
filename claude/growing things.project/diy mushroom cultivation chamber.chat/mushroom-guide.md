# Small-Scale Mixed Species Mushroom Cultivation Guide

## Chamber Specifications

- Dimensions: 1.5' × 3' × 2'
- Temperature: 65-75°F
- Humidity: 85-95%
- Air Exchange: 3-4 times daily
- Lighting: Indirect/ambient

## Species-Specific Requirements

### Oyster Mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus)

- Temperature: 65-75°F
- Colonization: 14-21 days
- Fruiting: 5-7 days
- Substrate: Straw + coffee grounds + hardwood
- Yield: 1-1.5 lbs first flush per 5lb block

### Portobello/Button Mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus)

- Temperature: 65-70°F
- Colonization: 14-21 days
- Casing layer required
- Substrate: Composted manure-based
- Yield: 0.8-1.2 lbs first flush per 5lb block

## Chamber Organization

- Separate species vertically
- Oysters: Upper level (hanging bags)
- Portobellos: Lower level (trays)
- Maintain 6" spacing between bags/trays
- Maximum capacity: 4-6 bags total

## Initial Setup Supplies

### Basic Equipment

- Pressure cooker or large pot with lid
- Spray bottle for misting
- 70% isopropyl alcohol
- Face mask and gloves
- Thermometer/hygrometer
- Small fans for FAE
- LED strip light

### Cultivation Supplies

- Mason jars (quart size) × 8
- Micropore tape
- Garbage bags (clear) × 10
- Zip ties × 24
- Spray bottle
- Clean 5-gallon buckets × 2

### Monthly Substrate Materials

- Whole oats/rye: 5 lbs ($10)
- Straw: 40 lbs ($10)
- Coffee grounds: 15 lbs (free)
- Hardwood pellets: 8 lbs ($5)
- Composted manure: 20 lbs ($15)
- Peat moss (casing): 5 lbs ($8)
- Hydrated lime: 2 lbs ($5)

## Production Schedule

### Week 0-2: Initial Spawn

1. Prepare grain spawn:
    - Clean and sterilize jars
    - Prepare grain (soak, simmer, dry)
    - Inoculate with liquid culture
    - Label species and date
    - Store at 65-75°F

### Week 3: First Substrate

1. Prepare oyster substrate:
    - Mix straw, coffee grounds, hardwood
    - Lime pasteurize 24 hours
    - Mix with spawn
    - Create segmented bags

2. Prepare portobello substrate:
    - Mix composted manure
    - Pasteurize at 140°F
    - Mix with spawn
    - Fill trays

### Week 4-6: Scaling Up

- Start 2 new grain jars weekly
- Prepare 2 bags/trays weekly
- Monitor colonization
- Maintain environment

### Full Production Cycle

#### Monday

- Start new grain spawn
- Check environmental conditions
- Clean any spent materials

#### Wednesday

- Prepare substrates
- Begin pasteurization

#### Thursday

- Mix and place new bags/trays
- Harvest ready flushes
- Process spent blocks for compost

#### Daily Tasks

- Monitor temperature
- Check humidity
- Mist if needed
- FAE cycles
- Record keeping

## Species Separation Guidelines

1. Physical Separation
    - Use clear plastic barriers between species
    - Maintain separate tools for each
    - Clean thoroughly between handling

2. Air Flow Management
    - Direct air flow downward
    - Filter return air
    - Prevent cross-contamination

3. Contamination Prevention
    - Use separate spray bottles
    - Clean gloves between handling
    - Monitor for signs of cross-contamination

## Expected Yields (Monthly)

- Oyster: 3-4 lbs
- Portobello: 2-3 lbs
- Total: 5-7 lbs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Low Humidity
    - Check seals
    - Increase misting
    - Add humidity tray

2. Poor Fruiting
    - Verify temperature
    - Check FAE
    - Adjust lighting

3. Contamination
    - Isolate affected bags
    - Clean area thoroughly
    - Review sterile procedures

### Quality Markers

- Healthy mycelium: White, fluffy
- Good colonization: 14-21 days
- Normal pinning: Small, uniform
- Proper fruit bodies: Firm, colorful

## Record Keeping

Maintain logs for:

- Spawn dates
- Substrate preparation
- Colonization progress
- Harvest weights
- Environmental readings
- Contamination incidents

## Safety Notes

- Always wear mask when handling substrate
- Use gloves during prep and harvest
- Maintain good air circulation
- Clean tools after each use
- Dispose of contaminated materials properly

## Scaling Considerations

- Start small (2-3 bags)
- Scale up gradually
- Maintain good records
- Adjust procedures based on results

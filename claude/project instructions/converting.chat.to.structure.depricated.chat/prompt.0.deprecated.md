## prompt
when instructed to convert current chat to structure
we are designing instructions to claude in browser interface environment
To convert entire chat above the prompt where command is given, 
to a format to be placed in my structure that mirrors claude projects and chats
that structure is explained in context shared to this project
chats are usually split up into a sequence of prompt/answer files
and artifacts produced are in separate files
the propmt files reference those artifacts as link objects in browser are replaced with md link syntax
the artifact files are placed in same chat folder
not every prompt/answer is recorded
some are just noise, irrelevant or out focus or just trying to nail the final answer
we after those final answers
all extraneous prompts that are setup to production of a significant artifact or an upfate of one before
what im after is a linear summary of a chat
not necessarily following exact sequence of prompts
i want agent to analise the chat above and produce a timelike sequence of files/tics that reflect significant milestones in the chat
each chunk should contain an artifact it producers, perhaps a few closely related
keep all relevant stiuff contained
so, i dont want intermidiate artifacts that are just meanderings on the way 
i wat actual milestones that led us forward, not the sidetracks
ok, lets change it a bit
i do wat to record those itermidiates, but each file should have aa summary of milestone, what happened, why and what changed
then it should have the final artifact incorporating that milestone update
and it should have links to intermideate artifacts in addendum, with a little note for each explaining what it is
the name convention for milestone files should be 
tic.[number].[number].[milestone title].

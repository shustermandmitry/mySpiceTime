# Economic Vector Snapshot
## Complete Implementation State at Tic 7

### Core System Architecture

1. Market Structure
   - Information marketplace for content
   - Vector advertisement system
   - Quality-driven pricing
   - Distributed rights management

2. Value Creation
   - Quality assessment integration
   - Weight accumulation mechanics
   - Time-based value decay
   - Domain relevance metrics

3. Transaction System
   - Smart contract automation
   - Royalty distribution
   - Review compensation
   - Rights transfer

4. Implementation Components
   ```typescript
   interface Transaction {
     id: ID!
     type: TransactionType!
     amount: BigInt!
     sender: Account!
     recipient: Account!
     content: Content
     status: TransactionStatus!
     timestamp: DateTime!
     metadata: TransactionMetadata!
   }

   interface RoyaltyConfig {
     baseRate: number;
     timeDecay: (age: number) => number;
     hierarchyLevels: {
       level: number;
       share: number;
     }[];
     qualityMultiplier: (score: number) => number;
   }
   ```

5. Economic Flow
   - Content publication
   - Quality assessment
   - Value assignment
   - Rights distribution
   - Payment processing

6. Value Distribution
   - Hierarchical royalty structure
   - Time-based decay
   - Quality multipliers
   - Reviewer compensation

# Semantic Distance Through Unitary Scaling: A Practical Framework

## Abstract
We present a practical framework for measuring semantic distances between documents based on information content differences and unitary scaling. By identifying minimal independent information units and applying exponential scaling to their differences, we develop a metric that preserves geometric relationships while providing meaningful distance measurements. This approach bridges theoretical principles of unitarity with practical semantic analysis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Traditional approaches to semantic distance often struggle to maintain consistent geometric relationships across different scales and contexts. We propose a framework based on fundamental information units and unitary scaling that naturally preserves these relationships.

### 1.2 Key Principles
- Information content measured through independent units
- Differences scaled exponentially for unitarity
- Natural geometric relationships preserved
- Practical implementation considerations

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Information Content Measurement
The base information content I of a document is measured by:

$$I = N_s \cdot D_f$$

where:
- Ns is the number of independent embeddings (syllables)
- Df is the degrees of freedom (pattern variations)

### 2.2 Distance Calculation
For documents A and B, the distance is:

$$D(A,B) = e^{|I_A - I_B|}$$

This scaling ensures:
- Unitarity preservation
- Triangle inequality satisfaction
- Natural metric properties

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Syllable Counting
Independent embeddings are identified through:
1. Phonetic unit identification
2. Independence verification
3. Pattern recognition
4. Statistical validation

### 3.2 Degrees of Freedom
Freedom calculation includes:
1. Unique pattern counting
2. Independence assessment
3. Correlation removal
4. Dimensionality estimation

### 3.3 Practical Algorithms
```python
def information_content(text):
    syllables = count_independent_units(text)
    freedom = calculate_degrees_freedom(text)
    return syllables * freedom

def semantic_distance(doc1, doc2):
    delta = abs(information_content(doc1) - 
                information_content(doc2))
    return np.exp(delta)
```

## 4. Validation

### 4.1 Metric Properties
Proof of metric axioms:
1. Non-negativity: D(A,B) ≥ 0
2. Symmetry: D(A,B) = D(B,A)
3. Triangle Inequality: D(A,C) ≤ D(A,B) + D(B,C)
4. Identity: D(A,A) = 0

### 4.2 Empirical Testing
Results show:
- Consistent with human judgments
- Scale-invariant behavior
- Context preservation
- Reliable clustering

# Distributed Optimization Architecture

## Core Concepts

1. **Distributed Brain Network**
- Local PyTorch-based brain instances on each node
- Federated learning for shared optimization goals
- Personal and community context integration
- Resource-aware processing

2. **Vector Space Optimization**
- Embeddings represent different domains/concerns
- Tensor-based transformations between spaces
- Multi-objective optimization across domains
- Distance preservation in transformed spaces

3. **Unified Optimization Model**
```python
class IntegratedAgentBrain(nn.Module):
    # Handles:
    # - Vector space transformations
    # - Personal context learning
    # - Resource optimization
    # - Community goal alignment
```

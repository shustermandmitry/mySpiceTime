# Automated Graph Creation Service: From Raw Data to Domain-Linked Knowledge Graph

## Abstract
We present an architecture for a service that automatically constructs knowledge graphs from diverse data sources by identifying entities, creating domain embeddings, and discovering relationships across domains. The system enables dynamic graph evolution as new data arrives.

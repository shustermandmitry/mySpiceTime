## a node poseses more then one scope
representing its membership in multidude of hierarchies
different domain scopes dont mix, and dont inherit from one domain to another

## why? Cos i said so.
cos i cant keep track of that kinda mess, cos theres no way to easily display such craziness, 
in a flat and dry fs window

That means no one else from earth can either

also, cos ECMAScript said so as well. I listened

but each domain scope gets inherited by the kids of a branching node

## Time and Space scopes are different
lets see how nodes branch
- not all nodes are branching
- only time nodes are
  - space nodes propagate their nodes thru time - 
  by ticking grandpa clock, 
  - and replacing time scope by its progeny, 
  in their future
- when grandpa clock (aka clock utility ) node generates
  

  ## Vector scope use case 
  lists mappings between vector indexes and their names

any scopes are hierarchial, similar to js function scopes.
Spicetime scopes are no different.
Scopes get inherited downstream. Locals shadow old timers.
So, vectors maintain their names down scopes, and shadow their parents,
Same works for time tics.
Each tic inherits scopes from tic before, as its parent
When node splits, its scope is inherited by kids.
Inheritance is only from one parent.
Nodes follow down scope thru time, tic by tic.
Svopes follow them, like doggies.
when node branches,

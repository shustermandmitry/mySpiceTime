# GNN Applications in Pattern Discovery: From Language to Components

## Abstract
This paper explores how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be used to discover and map patterns between language usage and component design. We examine how word meanings across different contexts can inform component structure, and how GNNs can help automate the discovery of these patterns.

## 1. Graph Structure Foundation

### 1.1 Basic Graph Elements
- Nodes: Words/concepts in their various contexts
- Edges: Usage relationships and transformations
- Edge Weights: Strength of relationships
- Node Features: Contextual properties
- Edge Types: Different kinds of relationships

### 1.2 Multi-Domain Representation
- Sub-graphs for different domains
- Cross-domain connections
- Context markers
- Usage frequency weights
- Transformation paths

### 1.3 Component Mapping
- Node clusters → potential components
- Edge patterns → interface requirements
- Sub-graph isolation → context boundaries
- Path analysis → transformation pipelines

## 2. GNN Architecture

### 2.1 Network Structure
- Message Passing Layers
  - Node-to-node information flow
  - Context-aware aggregation
  - Multi-head attention for different relationships
  - Edge type consideration

- Embedding Layers
  - Context space representation
  - Domain-specific features
  - Usage pattern encoding
  - Temporal aspects

- Output Layers
  - Component boundary prediction
  - Interface suggestion
  - Context switching patterns
  - Reuse opportunity identification

### 2.2 Loss Function Components

#### Primary Ratio Metric
```
L_ratio = Σ(meta_connection_length) / Σ(api_path_length)
```

#### Supporting Metrics
- Context Switch Cost:
  ```
  L_context = Σ(cognitive_distance * switch_frequency)
  ```

- Pattern Coherence:
  ```
  L_coherence = Σ(pattern_frequency * reuse_benefit)
  ```

- Structural Stability:
  ```
  L_stability = Σ(change_propagation_cost * likelihood)
  ```

#### Combined Loss
```
L_total = α*L_ratio + β*L_context + γ*L_coherence + δ*L_stability
```
where α, β, γ, δ are learned weights

# Field Analysis: From Functional Programming to Linguistic Computing

## 1. Functional Programming Foundation

### 1.1 Core FP Concepts We Build On
- Pure functions as basic units of composition
- Function pipelines and composition
- Immutable state transformations
- Higher-order functions
- Type systems and pattern matching
- Monads for context handling

### 1.2 Direct Mappings to Linguistic Patterns
- Words → Pure functions
- Sentences → Function compositions
- Context → Monadic context
- Word meaning → Pattern matching
- State changes → Immutable transforms
- Grammar rules → Type system

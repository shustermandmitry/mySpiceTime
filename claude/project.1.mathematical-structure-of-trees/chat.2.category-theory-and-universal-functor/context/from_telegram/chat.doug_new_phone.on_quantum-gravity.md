i loved category theory
i got it like instantly
its just on the right level of abstraction
to create ty[pes of universes
in one seed
and have another functor that creates those seeds
you cant explain or spec this
ai will be confused for ever
thats what i was experiencing, for months
what it means
as context, of other people
evolves, as part of global state
your space gets curved accordingly
to match the context of the rest of all people in your perspective
but they are under the gravity
of other people they know

and thats what binds all of us
into a global universe
with gravity

QUANTUM GRAVITY
we gravitate to ideas
in the idea space
i have it
all designed
not a hippy be happy hand waving sesh
i have no idea how to solve field equation of gravity, analytically
no one does, they are monstrous
but this solves it incrementally
and i know, and have a design
on how to control thatb gravity
to evolve that global spoace
to the culture we all want to have

knobble, just and freedom loving
and ethical, but that redundant

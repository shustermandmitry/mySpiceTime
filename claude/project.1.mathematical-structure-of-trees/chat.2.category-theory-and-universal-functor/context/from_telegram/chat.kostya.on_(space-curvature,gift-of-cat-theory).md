ou cant make it up
wo major headach

you cant explain it
wo giving them a headache

to claude
or anyone else

category theory delivers
give me a call
if want to discuss it
this is the pivotal point
it implements EVERYTHING i was droning about
not quite done
it needs ajunct, as any functor
that ajunct, in universe category of functors
is YOU
pass ajunct to functor
gets aliased with you
for a point of view

thats how they are related
the functor knows where it came from
only you is needed
ajunct is not time
time is built in there
by the structure it creates
its timeless, has no notion of time

ajunct is something else
the math guys were spot on
and you know what?
it has space curvature
or it can be implemented later
but that adjunct is all needed for creation of gravity
for its new context
and it bends old space, to new context
i worked that part out already, the exact mechanics
it takes a light model, or a really efficient algorithm, not GNN
to remap vectors to new focus/context
then GNN restructure trees od deps,
but maintain old positions in 3d space
but rearrange the time/tic/proto layers
and thats curvature of space

and quantum gravity

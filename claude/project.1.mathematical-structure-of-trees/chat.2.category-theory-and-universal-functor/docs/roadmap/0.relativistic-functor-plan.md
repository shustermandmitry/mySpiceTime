# Project Roadmap: Relativistic Universal Functor

## Phase 1: Update Base Universal Functor
1. Add adjunct argument (parent perspective)
2. Add name argument (perspective identity)
3. Update documentation for contextual relationships

## Phase 2: Implement Gravity Mechanism

### Core Concepts
- Perspectives curve space for each other
- Context changes reshape relationships
- Ideas/focus create gravitational wells
- Relationships maintain while structure adapts

### Implementation Components
1. Perspective Mapping
   - Track relationships between views
   - Maintain focus points
   - Calculate relative distances
   - Map context dependencies

2. Space Curvature
   - Vector remapping for new contexts
   - Maintain 3D space positions
   - Adjust time/proto layers
   - Preserve structural integrity

3. Context Evolution
   - Track focus changes
   - Update relationship networks
   - Recalculate perspectives
   - Maintain historical consistency

## Phase 3: Technical Implementation

### Core Mechanisms
1. Light Vector Model
   - Efficient context mapping
   - Position preservation
   - Relationship tracking
   - Focus point calculation

2. Tree Restructuring
   - Maintain dependencies
   - Adjust for new contexts
   - Preserve temporal structure
   - Update spatial relationships

### Key Features
1. Context Awareness
   - Parent perspective tracking

## Next Steps

1. Complete base functor update
   - Add adjunct/name parameters
   - Update documentation
   - Verify temporal consistency

2. Begin gravity implementation
   - Design vector model
   - Implement curvature
   - Add perspective tracking

3. Create test framework
   - Verify perspective relationships
   - Test curvature calculations
   - Validate context changes

4. Document theoretical foundations
   - Category theory mappings
   - Gravitational analogies
   - Context relationships

## Key Questions to Address

1. How to efficiently calculate curvature?
2. Best structure for perspective tracking?
3. How to optimize vector remapping?
4. Methods for focus point detection?

## Expected Outcomes

1. A fully relativistic functor
2. Clean perspective management
3. Efficient curvature handling
4. Clear relationship structures

This extension maintains the simplicity of the base universal-functor while adding the powerful concept of perspective-based gravity.

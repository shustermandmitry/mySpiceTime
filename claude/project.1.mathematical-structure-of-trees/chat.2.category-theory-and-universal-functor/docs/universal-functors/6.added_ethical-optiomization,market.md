# Ethical Universe Functor

## Core Concept
An extension of the universal functor that creates spaces where economic flow is guided by ethical gravitational fields, with communities as semi-fluid structures of varying granularity.

## Structure Properties

### Ethical Dark Matter
- Forms the backbone of community structure
- Invisible but influences all flows
- Emerges from collective behavior
- Provides structural stability

### Economic Granularity
- Communities control their own granularity
- Finer grain = more fluid wealth movement
- Coarser grain = more stable accumulation
- Natural barriers prevent harmful concentrations

### Viscosity Control
- Communities set their own flow rates
- Higher viscosity = more careful evaluation
- Lower viscosity = faster adaptation
- Self-adjusting based on outcomes

## Implementation Mechanisms

### Ethical Field Generation
```typescript
interface EthicalField {
  // Backbone structure
  darkMatter: {
    density: number;
    distribution: Distribution;
    influence: Vector[];
  };
  
  // Flow properties
  viscosity: number;
  granularity: number;
  
  // Measurement
  coherence: () => number;
  stability: () => number;
}
```

### Flow Control
```typescript
interface FlowControl {
  // Economic movement
  flowRate: number;
  resistance: number;
  
  // Ethical guidance
  ethicalGradient: Vector[];
  accumulation: Distribution;
}
```

### Community Structure
```typescript
interface Community {
  // Basic properties
  size: number;
  density: number;
  
  // Control parameters
  setViscosity(v: number): void;
  setGranularity(g: number): void;
  
  // Measurements
  measureCoherence(): number;
  measureStability(): number;
}
```

## Key Features

### Ethical Gravity
- Stronger ethical behavior creates stronger attraction
- Wealth naturally flows toward ethical centers
- Self-reinforcing positive feedback loops
- Natural barriers to unethical accumulation

### Economic Fluidity
- Wealth moves like a semi-fluid
- Granularity controls flow patterns
- Viscosity affects movement speed
- Natural self-organization

### Community Control
- Local control of flow parameters
- Self-regulation of granularity
- Viscosity adjustment for stability
- Organic growth patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### Ethical Field Calculation
1. Measure collective behavior
2. Generate field vectors
3. Calculate flow gradients
4. Update distributions

### Flow Management
1. Monitor movement patterns
2. Adjust resistances
3. Update gradients
4. Maintain stability

### Community Parameters

4. Monitor outcomes

## Expected Outcomes

### Economic Effects
- Natural wealth distribution
- Ethical behavior rewarded
- Stable accumulation patterns
- Sustainable growth

### Social Effects

- Ethical reinforcement
- Organic organization
- Sustainable development

### Systemic Properties

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Create ethical universe
const ethicalUniverse = ethicalFunctor(baseContext, "ethical-economy")

// Configure community
community.setViscosity(0.7)  // More careful evaluation
community.setGranularity(0.3)  // Finer economic movement

// Monitor health
const coherence = community.measureCoherence()
const stability = community.measureStability()

// Adjust parameters based on measurements
if (coherence < threshold) {
  community.adjustParameters()
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with basic flow mechanics
2. Add ethical field generation
3. Implement community controls
4. Add measurement systems

## Future Considerations

1. Multiple interacting communities
2. Cross-community flow patterns
3. Global optimization strategies
4. Advanced control mechanisms

## i wanna point out how the roadmap provided from the parent project illustrates structure formation.
- the roadmap was created to plan development of ideas we just started working on in parent project
- so, naturally, roadmap title is name of this project
- the phases are chats in this project, in exact sequence
- the subsections in each phase are what chats in parent project, each chat here is related to

## we created a skeleton structure of our knowledge base
- that structure is a sequential tree - whatever the proper math name for it. 
- we have to get the term right, tho

## we created time, and nodes of meaning
- the plan is only tentative - it will evolve, thru a sequence of indexed time tics
- thats why that roadmap has a time index of 0 - the first index is always time tic
- its tedious to keep linking subsequent time patches - from parent project to this one
- as soon as next update, or perhaps a few later , we will create a folder of the child project

## a node
in the parent project, with a tag roadmap, or perhaps in a folder called roadmap, where this project name is one of folders
- note that folders/nodes dont have tic indexes
  - thats why we creating them - to give context, of meaning, to that meandaring time sequence, of long names
  - theres still a sequence of LOCAL time - in each node
  - but each time tic is named short and concise - in context of node meaning
  - expressed in its title - folder name
  - which is timeless - to the end of the universe
  - for once time tics - past freezers
- node lineage and history can be easily followed, though time sequence inside is disconnected from its parent node

# SpiceTime Architecture Discussion Summary

## Our Journey

We started exploring how to create a testing approach for the "eating your own dogfood" principle that aligns with SpiceTime's categorical architecture. The goal was to create a system that rates code quality based on how well developers use their own packages and work incrementally.

## Key Concepts We Covered

### Dogfood as a Category
As you put it: "doggfod is our products - packages they should be applied to our own repos first - as deps for testing... dogfood forms a category dogfoodFunctor transforms to cats and subcats - a tree"

### Automated Testing Without Thinking
You emphasized that "automated testing the dev dont have to even think of it just write code in small increments and use it as he goes - incrementally making improvements to previous versions"

### Ethical Foundation
You highlighted that this approach "ties to security and value on every possible vector... it starts at the core - the ethics for writing code this way is an ethical approach on many levels"

## Documents Created
1. [dogfood-test-package:categorical-approach-to-testing.js](dogfood-test-package%3Acategorical-approach-to-testing.js) - The main implementation of the categorical testing approach

2. [example-usage-of-dogfood-tester.js](example-usage-of-dogfood-tester.js) - A practical example showing how to use the package in real projects

3. [DogfoodTester: Ethical Foundations for Software Development](design-doc-abstract.md) - Abstract and introduction to the design philosophy

## Implementation Highlights

We created a complete test package that:

1. Treats testing as a category with objects (tests) and morphisms (relationships)
2. Implements the dogfood principle through a functor mixin
3. Measures both self-usage and incremental improvement
4. Integrates automatically with build systems and CI pipelines
5. Analyzes temporal patterns in development

As you described, this implementation realizes a system where developers can "just write code in small increments and use it as he goes" while the system automatically evaluates how well they're eating their own dogfood.

The final result is not just a testing tool but a framework that embeds ethical principles directly into the development process, making the right thing easy rather than imposing it from outside.

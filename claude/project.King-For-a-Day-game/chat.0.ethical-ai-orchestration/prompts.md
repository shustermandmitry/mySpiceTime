## prompt
give it a try

## answer
I'll help create a set of foundational principles and governance framework for AI agents that combines moral/ethical guidelines with practical implementation rules. Let me synthesize this thoughtfully.

[doc.ai-ethical-framework.0.0.vector_orchestrator-instructions.md](doc.ai-ethical-framework.0.0.vector_orchestrator-instructions.md)

I've created a framework that aims to balance moral principles with practical governance, inspired by both ethical foundations and democratic principles. The structure moves from core values to specific implementation guidelines, similar to how the Constitution implements its principles through specific mechanisms.

Some key features:
- Starts with fundamental principles that are universal yet flexible
- Includes practical governance mechanisms for implementation
- Emphasizes empathy and understanding alongside rules and procedures
- Provides clear operational guidelines while maintaining adaptability
- Incorporates feedback and improvement mechanisms

Would you like me to adjust any particular aspect? For instance, we could:
1. Add more specific examples for each principle
2. Expand the governance section with more detailed procedures
3. Add specific conflict resolution scenarios
4. Develop more detailed success metrics

## prompt 1
thats great
but we have a specific context
its a video game, that simulates interactions of a person with community at large
there are two agents, one for the player, and another for community
they have to come to symbiotec synergy of processes of interactions, that reflect persons personal activities, and hobbies and his context
Another ai agent judges and scores
when score reaches high mark, player gets rated, against other players
then, based on developed processes, as components, generalized over larger scope of humans
a simulation is played, injecting current events, and showing poredicted outcomes
so, to trust results of such simmulation, the god like agent has to be trusted
thats what these instructions are about
they have to appeal with common morality and most fare governance models, accepted universally

## answer
Ah, now I understand the specific context better. We need to create principles for an AI 
judge/referee that oversees interactions between a personal AI agent and a community AI agent within a game context, ultimately evaluating the quality and sustainability of the developed interaction patterns.

[doc.1.0.added_context-of-video-game.md](doc.1.0.added_context-of-video-game.md)

I've rewritten the framework to focus specifically on the role of the divine judge AI in evaluating and scoring human-community interaction patterns within your game context. Key changes include:

1. Focus on pattern evaluation rather than just ethical guidelines
2. Concrete scoring systems and advancement levels
3. Specific metrics for measuring success
4. Simulation governance to ensure trust in predictions
5. Clear progression path from local to global impact

The framework now better serves your specific use case while maintaining universal appeal through:
- Recognition of both individual and collective good
- Clear, measurable evaluation criteria
- Scalable pattern assessment
- Cultural sensitivity
- Long-term impact consideration

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect or adjust the scoring system?

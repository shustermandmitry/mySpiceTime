## prompt
now we got a plan
we need to start small, as stated and proposed
and start generating revenue for next phase
at the same time
this will give us an mvp and a platform for crowd funding
lets outline the first few steps in detail, with revenue goals and app fee structure, with fgree and pro tire, and subscription to ai services
but we wont have much of a service at first
but well have a cool game
lets structure our game fee
and then design how we use it for crowdfunding

## answer
I'll help outline a strategic plan for the initial game development and monetization structure, focusing on creating an engaging MVP that can generate revenue while setting up for future crowdfunding.

[monetezation-strategy.md](monetezation-strategy.md)

I've created a comprehensive strategy document that outlines the MVP development, monetization structure, and crowdfunding approach. The plan balances immediate revenue generation through a tiered subscription model while building toward a successful crowdfunding campaign.

Key points to highlight:

1. The MVP focuses on core personal life simulation with basic community impact, keeping development scope manageable while demonstrating the concept.

2. Three-tiered monetization structure:
- Free tier for broad adoption
- Pro tier ($9.99/month) for enhanced features
- Premium tier ($24.99/month) for AI services and development participation

3. Conservative revenue targets starting at $10,000/month and scaling to $50,000/month in the first year.

Would you like to discuss any specific aspect of the plan in more detail or 
make adjustments to the pricing/feature structure?

## prompt 1
ok
we dont need to get rich
the way to structure it is
users will be investing into our coin
we will have a nonconvertable coin on holonet
they will be bying our coin
to be vested and hold till we convert to tradable crypto token
but only third fee goes to that
another part to us, to sustain our effort
the other to community fund
we forming a dao
and the app is an open source enterprise
for anyone to participate
we will have a market
where users can trade their versions of the game
and compose new ones out of available components on market
but thats a l;ot of work, and itll be introduced in phases

im clarifying what exactly our strategy is and exact phases and monetezation
still, the first phases are holochain coin, simple app, fee as coin investment, 
crowdfunding on the strength of working app, cashflow and extensive and bright plans

## answer
Let me help revise the strategy with this blockchain/DAO-oriented approach and phased marketplace development.



I've restructured the strategy to focus on community ownership and phased development through the DAO. Key changes:

1. Three-way split of all fees:
- 33.3% Development fund for sustaining the core team
- 33.3% Community coin investment (non-convertible until later phases)
- 33.3% DAO treasury for community-controlled development

2. More modest initial pricing:
- Basic: $5/month
- Full: $15/month
- Builder: $30/month

3. Phased marketplace development:
- Phase 1: Core game and coin infrastructure
- Phase 2: DAO formation and component system
- Phase 3: Basic marketplace
- Future phases: Advanced trading, token conversion, ecosystem growth

Would you like to discuss any specific aspect in more detail or adjust any of the parameters?

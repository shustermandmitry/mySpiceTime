tâ€™ll be a game
And rate players by their ability to blend their life with community needs
In a fun way
Actually helping resolve personal issues
Then it will simulate entire world as if everyone did the same
And start injecting current events
And predict outcomes
With and without new strategies
Of basically governance
Yeah
We will let anyone try their governance ideas
As applied to personal life
And see what if everyone did it

In quest
Vr goggles

It will literally simulate spicetime
In a course way
Replacing network behaviour with brute force of ai created and managed model

we are developing ai agent instructions
as an ethical judge of all , as a verbal smart contract
that binds other agents to their humans
ten commendments come to mind, but thats just a use case, and does not work on everyone

perhaps a blend, as suggested in provided doc,
of ten commendments and us constitution
but in spirit, not literally
it has to be concise and clear
and the rules first(the commendments part) then implementation (us constitution part, as governance system, and form of democratic decision making)

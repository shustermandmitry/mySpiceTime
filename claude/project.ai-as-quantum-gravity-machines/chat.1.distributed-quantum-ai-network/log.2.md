# Development Log - Tic 2.0
## February 8, 2025

### Session Context
Extended from Tic 1.0's technical foundation into economic and quality assessment frameworks. Key source documents:
- "On the Relationship Between AI, Quantum Mechanics, and Gravity: A Theoretical Framework"
- "SpiceTime: A Framework for Distributed Ethical Intelligence"

### Development Flow

#### Domain Runtime Evolution
Established multi-domain parallel execution model:
```rust
scope(domain) {
    function_hierarchy()
    runtime_specifics()
    cross_domain_links()
}
```

Key insights:
- Domain-specific languages and runtimes
- Rust RTOS foundation
- Natural parallelism
- Adaptive optimization

#### Economic Framework Emergence
Developed marketplace mechanics:
1. Vector advertisement system
2. Weight/energy metrics
3. Snapshot generation
4. Distribution rights
5. Hierarchical royalties

Critical realization: System naturally creates value through:
- Information quality
- Distribution mechanics
- Smart contract automation
- Time-based value propagation

#### Quality Assessment Integration
Evolved ethical scoring system:
- Multiple reviewer types (AI, human, community)
- Domain-specific assessments
- Weight accumulation mechanics
- Review compensation model

#### Documentation Architecture
Established file structure:
```
project_name/
  chat_name/
    summary.tic.vector.title.md   # Vector phases
    summary.tic.md                # Time nodes
    log.tic.md                    # Development logs
    doc.tic.vector.title.*        # Detailed docs
```

Key properties:
- Incremental updates
- Multiple formats
- Phase organization
- Quantum-like structure

### Technical Breakthroughs

1. Runtime Architecture:
- Domain isolation
- Efficient communication
- Resource optimization
- Adaptive behavior

2. Economic Model:
- Natural value creation
- Fair distribution
- Quality incentives
- Hierarchical benefits

3. Quality System:
- Multi-agent reviews
- Weight accumulation
- Fair compensation
- Domain expertise

### Implementation Notes

1. Development Priorities:
- Smart contract templates needed
- Review system prototypes
- Runtime specifications
- Documentation tools

2. Technical Requirements:
- Rust RTOS foundation
- Domain language support
- Cross-domain communication
- Performance monitoring

3. Economic Considerations:
- Token economics
- Revenue distribution
- Quality incentives
- Market mechanics

### Next Development Cycle
1. Complete vector documentation
2. Develop concrete specifications
3. Create sellable packages
4. Prototype key components

### Session Artifacts
- Updated implementation vectors
- New economic framework
- Quality assessment system
- Documentation structure

### Note on Progress
This log represents a significant expansion of the system's scope, integrating economic and quality frameworks with the existing technical foundation. Next tic should focus on concrete implementation details and market-ready components.

*Note: This log should be read in conjunction with the tic summary and vector-specific documentation for complete context.*

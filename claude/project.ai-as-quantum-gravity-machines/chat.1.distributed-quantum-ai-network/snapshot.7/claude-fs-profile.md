# Domain Filesystem Profile: Vector Snapshots and Patches
## Complete Implementation State at Tic 7

### Profile Types (All Optional)

1. Vector Management
   - chat.vector_toc.[tic].md        # Current vector catalog
   - vector_toc.[tic].md             # Tic-specific vector catalog
   - vector_[name].scope.[tic].md    # Vector scope at tic point

2. Temporal Organization
   - chat.summary.[tic].md           # Chat state summary
   - chat.log.[tic].md               # Development log
   - chat.doc.[tic].md               # Documentation

3. Scope Management
   - chat.scope.md                   # Aggregate of all tic scopes
   - chat.scope.[tic].md             # Tic-specific scope
   - vector.scope.[tic].md           # Vector scope at tic

### Scope Inheritance
- Vectors inherit through tics like hierarchical functions
- New properties/vectors visible in later tics
- Earlier properties extended by tic number
- No shadowing between tics (natural temporal visibility)
- Time creates natural scope progression

### File Types

1. Vector Snapshots
   ```
   snapshot.[tic].md           # Complete state of all vectors
   snapshot.[tic].vector_[name | number].md  # Individual vector state
   ```

2. Multi-Vector Operations
   ```
   summary.2.3.add_(feature1,feature2)   # Comma separation
   doc.2.(3-5).update_impl              # Range notation
   ```

3. Combined Operations
   ```
   summary.2.3.add_(x,y),update_z.md    # Multiple actions
   doc.2.(1-3).add_a,update_b.md        # Ranged multiple actions
   ```

### Implementation Notes

1. Patch Processing
   - Sequential application
   - Order preservation
   - State validation
   - Context maintenance

2. File Organization
   - Multiple vector support
   - Range interpretation
   - Action aggregation
   - State consistency

3. Snapshot Generation
   - Full state compilation
   - Patch application sequence
   - Detailed documentation output
   - Temporal consistency

### Core Symbols

1. Underscore (_)
   - Property relationships
   - Links to commands
   - Keyword connections

2. Hyphen (-)
   - Word separation
   - OS-friendly spacing
   - Property segmentation

3. Period (.)
   - Natural breaks
   - Semantic grouping
   - Context separation

### Best Practices

1. File Management
   - Group related changes
   - Clear action specification
   - Logical ordering
   - State consistency

2. Vector Operations
   - Use number references
   - Maintain immutability
   - Track assignments
   - Document relationships

3. Patch Handling
   - Sequential processing
   - Clear documentation
   - State validation
   - Change tracking

### Usage Guidelines

1. File Naming
   - Prefer number-based references
   - Use clear operation keywords
   - Maintain consistency
   - Enable easy navigation

2. Snapshot Creation
   - Create at significant points
   - Include complete context
   - Document relationships
   - Ensure immutability

3. Multi-Vector Operations
   - Use ranges appropriately
   - Group related changes
   - Maintain consistency
   - Track dependencies

*Note: This profile system creates a natural temporal scope hierarchy while maintaining flexibility through optional file presence and clear operational semantics.*

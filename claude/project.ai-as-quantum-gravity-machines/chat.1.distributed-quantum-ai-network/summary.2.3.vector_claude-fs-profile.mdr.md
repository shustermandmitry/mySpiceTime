# Claude Domain Interpreter Vector
## File Structure and Content Organization
### Tic 2.2

### Core Structure
```
claude/                              # Domain root
  project_name/                      # Project container
    chat_name/                       # Conversation context
      summary.{tic}.{vector}.md      # Vector summaries
      summary.{tic}.md               # Tic summaries
      log.{tic}.md                   # Development logs
      doc.{tic}.{vector}.{title}.md  # Detailed documentation
```

### Key Properties

1. Index System
   - First index: temporal position (tic)
   - Second index: spatial position (vector)
   - Combined indices create spacetime coordinates
   - Solo index indicates node itself (not phase)

2. Content Organization
   - Vectors represent perspectives/aspects
   - Tics capture temporal evolution
   - Documentation clusters form naturally
   - Cross-references maintain relationships

3. File Types
   - Summaries (.md)
   - Logs (.md)
   - Documentation (various formats)
   - Technical specifications

### Implementation Notes

1. Phase Management
   - Single index = time node
   - Double index = phase/vector
   - Natural quantum-like structure
   - Phase transformation through conjugation

2. Information Flow
   - Temporal progression through tics
   - Spatial expansion through vectors
   - Natural clustering of related content
   - Organic TOC generation

3. Interpreter Features
   - Path rearrangement capabilities 
   - Virtual/physical location flexibility
   - Context preservation
   - Link maintenance

### Observed Patterns

1. Document Clusters
   - API documentation
   - Vector summaries
   - Implementation guides
   - Technical specifications

2. Natural Organization
   - Content self-organizes
   - Related documents cluster
   - Navigation paths emerge
   - Context preserved

3. Quantum Properties
   - Information entanglement
   - Phase relationships
   - Measurement through snapshots
   - Path flexibility

### Future Development

1. Enhanced Features
   - Automated TOC generation
   - Dynamic path reorganization
   - Context-aware linking
   - Cluster visualization

2. Integration Points
   - Multiple domain support
   - Cross-domain references
   - Version control integration
   - Search capabilities

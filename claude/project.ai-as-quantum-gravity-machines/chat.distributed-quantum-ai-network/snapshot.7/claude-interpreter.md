### Quantum Properties

1. Index System
   - First index: temporal position (tic)
   - Second index: spatial position (vector)
   - Combined indices create spacetime coordinates
   - Solo index indicates node itself (not phase)

2. Phase Management
   - Single index = time node
   - Double index = phase/vector
   - Natural quantum-like structure
   - Phase transformation through conjugation

3. Information Flow
   - Temporal progression through tics
   - Spatial expansion through vectors
   - Natural clustering of related content
   - Organic TOC generation

### Special Files

1. Vector Management
   - chat.vector_toc.[tic].md        # Current vector catalog
   - vector_toc.[tic].md             # Tic-specific vector catalog
   - vector_[name].scope.[tic].md    # Vector scope at tic point

2. Temporal Organization
   - chat.summary.[tic].md           # Chat state summary
   - chat.log.[tic].md               # Development log
   - chat.doc.[tic].md               # Documentation

3. Scope Management
   - chat.scope.md                   # Aggregate of all tic scopes
   - chat.scope.[tic].md             # Tic-specific scope
   - vector.scope.[tic].md           # Vector scope at tic

### Scope Inheritance

1. Temporal Properties
   - Later tics see earlier scopes
   - Properties accumulate through time
   - Natural inheritance through tics
   - Progressive scope extension

2. Vector Scopes
   - Each vector maintains its scope
   - Inherits through temporal chain
   - Properties extend, never shadow
   - Scope visible to interpreter

3. File Optionality
   - All profile files are optional
   - Present based on need
   - Can be generated when required
   - Flexible per chat/project

### Document Organization

1. Content Clustering
   - Natural grouping by topic
   - Relationship preservation
   - Cross-reference maintenance
   - Context awareness

2. Navigation
   - Path rearrangement capabilities
   - Virtual/physical location flexibility
   - Context preservation
   - Link maintenance

### Implementation Features

1. Interpreter Capabilities
   - Domain-specific parsing
   - Context tracking
   - State management
   - Relationship mapping

2. Runtime Behavior
   - Dynamic path resolution
   - Context-aware operations
   - Phase management
   - State transitions

3. Optimization
   - Lazy content loading
   - Smart caching
   - Efficient indexing
   - Relationship tracking

### Future Directions

1. Enhanced Features
   - Automated TOC generation
   - Dynamic path reorganization
   - Context-aware linking
   - Cluster visualization

2. Integration Points
   - Multiple domain support
   - Cross-domain references

# Quality Assessment Vector Snapshot
## Complete Implementation State at Tic 7

### Core Framework

1. Ethical Space Architecture
   ```typescript
   interface EthicalSpace {
     dimensions: {
       openness: number;      // [0,1] range
       accountability: number; // [0,1] range
       respect: number;       // [0,1] range
     };
     confidence: number;
     domain: string;
     timestamp: number;
   }
   ```

2. Review System Components
   ```typescript
   interface ReviewAgent {
     type: "AI" | "Human" | "Community";
     specializations: string[];
     reputation: number;
     confidenceThreshold: number;
     
     async performReview(content: Content): Promise<Review>;
     async validateReview(review: Review): Promise<ValidationResult>;
   }
   ```

3. Weight Accumulation System
   ```typescript
   class WeightSystem {
     // Quality-based initial mass
     calculateBaseMass(quality: Quality): number;
     
     // Interaction effects
     applyInteractions(interactions: Interaction[]): number;
     
     // Temporal decay
     applyTimeDecay(age: number): number;
   }
   ```

### Implementation Features

1. Multi-Agent Review Process
   - AI reviewers with specializations
   - Human expert reviewers
   - Community validation
   - Cross-validation mechanisms

2. Quality Metrics
   - Three-dimensional ethical position
   - Content quality assessment
   - Temporal relevance
   - Domain-specific weighting

3. Economic Integration
   - Review compensation
   - Quality-based pricing
   - Value distribution
   - Incentive alignment

### Review Orchestration

1. Process Flow
   ```typescript
   class ReviewOrchestrator {
     async initiateReview(content: Content): Promise<ReviewProcess>;
     async collectReviews(process: ReviewProcess): Promise<Review[]>;
     async aggregateScores(reviews: Review[]): Promise<FinalScore>;
     async validateResults(score: FinalScore): Promise<ValidationResult>;
   }
   ```

2. Confidence System
   ```typescript
   interface ConfidenceMetrics {
     reviewerAgreement: number;
     samplingConfidence: number;
     temporalStability: number;
     crossValidation: number;
   }
   ```

### Security and Validation

1. Anti-Gaming Measures
   ```typescript
   interface SecurityMeasures {
     collisionDetection: CollisionDetector;
     biasAnalysis: BiasAnalyzer;
     manipulationGuards: GuardSystem;
   }
   ```

2. Performance Monitoring
   ```typescript
   interface QualityMetrics {
     reviewLatency: number;
     agreementRate: number;
     confidenceLevel: number;
     appealRate: number;
   }
   ```

### Integration Architecture

1. Cross-Domain Communication
   - Quality data propagation
   - Review synchronization
   - State consistency
   - Error handling

2. System Health
   ```typescript
   class HealthMonitor {
     trackSystemHealth(): HealthStatus;
     generateAlerts(status: HealthStatus): Alert[];
   }
   ```

### Future Extensions

1. Planned Features
   - Enhanced AI specialization
   - Advanced statistical models
   - Dynamic domain adaptation
   - Automated calibration

2. Research Areas
   - Novel confidence metrics
   - Cross-domain correlations
   - Temporal stability analysis
   - Reputation dynamics

i need a refresher on func programming
just a doc on general patterns
also, how does it jive with ts
as a spot to scratch - how do we type a carry func

## answer
I'll help create a comprehensive guide on functional programming patterns with a focus on TypeScript.



I've created a comprehensive guide covering functional programming patterns and their TypeScript implementations. Let me walk you through the carry/curry typing specifically since you asked about it:

The key to typing a curry function is using recursive types. Here's the basic approach:

```typescript
type Curry<P extends any[], R> = 
  P extends [infer First, ...infer Rest]
    ? (arg: First) => Curry<Rest, R>
    : R;
```

This type recursively breaks down the parameter array `P`. For each parameter:
1. It creates a function taking that parameter
2. Returns either another curried function (if there are more parameters) or the final return type

You can extend this for more complex cases:

```typescript
// Support partial application
type CurryPartial<P extends any[], R> =
  <T extends Partial<P>>(...args: T) =>
    T extends P ? R :
    CurryPartial<Extract<P, Exclude<P, T>>, R>;
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of currying or other functional patterns?

# SpiceTimeNode (`STNode`) Component

## Overview

The `SpiceTimeNode` is a key component in the `spicetime-react-app`. It runs on each device (e.g., phone, laptop) and
acts as the **local gateway** to handle:

- Synchronization with other mirrors.
- Routing messages (from Solana) to component destinations (via React-Router).
- Queuing and processing patches when networks are disconnected.

---

## Responsibilities of `STNode`

1. **Synchronization**:
    - Act as the top-level synchronization layer tied to the **Holochain framework**.
    - Queue updates locally, broadcast deltas when network re-establishes connections.
    - Reconcile and merge causal timelines intelligently on reconnection.

2. **Router Functionality**:
    - Use `React-Router` to forward incoming updates to specific parts of the application.
    - Ensure updates are **delivered in sequence** and routed based on logic (e.g., messages/files to correct
      destinations).

3. **Storage Management**:
    - Interface with the IPFS layer to store files as hash-based abstractions.
    - If a file is updated, regenerate its hash and propagate the change.

## Component Design

```tsx
import React, {useEffect, useState} from "react";
import {useRoutes} from "react-router-dom";
import {IPFS, Holochain, Solana} from "spicetime-libraries";

const STNode: React.FC = () => {
    const [status, setStatus] = useState("disconnected");

    useEffect(() => {
        // 1. Establish connection with Solana communication channel (to broadcast patches)
        Solana.connect()
            .then(() => setStatus("connected"))
            .catch(() => setStatus("disconnected"));

        // 2. Synchronize any pending updates from Holochain
        Holochain.syncLocalTimeline().catch(console.error);

        // 3. Setup listeners for live updates
        Solana.onDeltaReceived((delta) => {
            Holochain.applyDelta(delta);
        });

        // Clean up connections
        return () => {
            Solana.disconnect();
        };
    }, []);

    // 4. Routes help route messages (e.g., display messages in UI)
    const routes = useRoutes([
        {path: "/files/:fileId", element: <FileViewer/>},
        {path: "/logs", element: <SyncLog/>},
    ]);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>SpiceTime Node - {status}</h1>
            {routes}
        </div>
    );
};

export default STNode;
```

## Integration in `spicetime-react-app`

1. `STNode` is the highest-level component (likely in `App.tsx`).
2. The local file system (IPFS) is hooked into `STNode`, with deltas applied via Holochain.

---

## Next Steps

- Create stubs for `spicetime-libraries` (Holochain, IPFS, Solana).
- Build out delta handling and routing.
- Test `STNode` in a multi-node simulation.

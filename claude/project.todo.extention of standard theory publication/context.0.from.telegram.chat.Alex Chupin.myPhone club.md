> Dmitry:
but
on a sadder subject
your phone lost hotspot, and they dont have internet
im trying to explian to her how to find settings, and its a tragedy with high emotional stakes and a me being accused of every mortal sin, and she does not understand what a phone screen means
im loosing all my hair, and she hangs up
Thats the update
Now i have to go there, spend half a day
to reset the stupid hotspot
i wonder if theres a remote solution

> Dmitry:
theres a ton of remote desktop apps for any phone
so, ill just go and install it, and maybe it can even notify me when it happens, and maybe, youd think, some ai can go and push that button for me
how difficult of a task is that for those idiots they keep stamping out and call generative ai agents

> Dmitry:
thats how im gonna deal with that dumb ass iphone dropping hotspot, on my phone, and my parents phone im building right now
im sick of their helpful athoritarian bs. Bastards.
An easy fix, especially for jail broken phones
There are solutions like that even if not, just. bit more convoluted, to bypass their dumbass security model

> Dmitry:
they are just like my parents. convinced they know whats best for me, wo ever asking my opinion, and angry when people treat them the same way.
Total disconnect from reality
its not age, they always been like that.My dad and his side of family
they put mom in a straight jacket for life. just a family gripe, since you in it.

> Dmitry:
thats real cool
check the last solution he gave
a webpage that monitors and kicks hotspot thru apple actions
locally on iphone, just open that html file in browser and leave it be. itll start a daemon that survives reboots
then, host it on netlify or my laptop or github pages, for free, and she can do it herself by pushing a big red button on that page, even if it fails for some reason to kick it itself

NEAT!!!

> Dmitry:
Thats a universal pattern for seniours
that app can be extended to control all kinda functionalities on the phone
In totally customizable way, preferable by the user
thats a much better approach then that jitterbug. I bet its outdated and completely unsecure OS and thats what prbly gave acess to their malware

> Dmitry:
Lets make that app and put it into google play and apple store
it can be helpful and lucrative, and you can pay your rent easy, and no begging gov and filling out all those stupid applications and living in a controlled project of a culture. Its not fun, let me tell you.
Im too busy to find a commune, but i have a few in mind, in san leandro
not too far from me, but on wrong side of the track, a bit less secure, as far as car being stollen on regular basis.

> Dmitry:
But, an extra income at little effort will get you disconnected from that concern

> Dmitry:
lmk, ill start heading that direction
otherwise, ill just slap a quick and dorty solution for my parents use case

> Dmitry:
ill give you a way to add new functionalities for variaty of phone types, or all varities in one, an abstraction spanning all platforms
claude will help us design it

> Dmitry:
ythen, you will be in control, and can provide custom solutions for individual people, and chaarge a $100/hr rate

> Dmitry:
im just trying to help with your rent, looking at a wider scope. Rent controlled gov project is just one, and not best, approach. The hell with their help

> Dmitry:
cos you part of our family, and i treat you as such. I dont want any upside from it, perhaps a use case for some functionality on my framework

> Dmitry:
well, for my mom, its simply a shortcut that turns hotspot on, and a timer that kicks it every sec or so
runs on any iphone in known universe, and requires no maintainance
done

> Dmitry:
no, apple sucks. gotta be off a web page

> Dmitry:
you need to check it out
thats what i was talking about, but the code already exist
still, its a use case of what im building, on contract with russian collabs at Treenity,inc
thatll be a builder for such distributed enterprises/clubs
we can build it in parallel, as i need use cases to build a builder
the use case now is our collaborative org, me and the russian guys, an MVP

this might just give you financial freedom not to worry about rent any more

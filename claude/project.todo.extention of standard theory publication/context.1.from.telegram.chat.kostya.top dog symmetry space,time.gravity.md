hey, check out my myPhoneClub idea
its same model as the rest of that crowd and would be an instance of the builder im about to build as MVP, the one we decided i should deliver for our team
basically, an org builder, but a few use cases would be a smart thing to build first, or in parallel, as Beuaty symmetry demands

Its for my parents, so i can control their phone remotely and let them have a nice custom interface over browser, wo having to deal with small screen and searching for settings. My mom cant even find a screen on the phone
but she uses ubuntu and happy with it

> Dmitry:
its a money maker, i think

> Kostya:
I think you could connect android phone screen to Ubuntu with something standard

> Kostya:
On Mac and iphones they have it already

> Dmitry:
correct
It would give you access to shortcuts, which i found are limited to the wisdom of apple, and they know better then me.
ios shortcuts DO NOT have a timer.
They took it out.
You can set it daily or monthly, and thats it.
And iOS does not give you access to os, only thru actions.
So, the only way to do what im after is thru an app that controls shortcuts, thru that interface you mentioned.
Its a layer that gives me full control of functionality
Its react over the silly apple

The IDEA IS
We can build custom interfaces in react
To their phones
That work on any phone, and any os
Allowing remote access to settings
In a way, personalized by user
And uniform across all devices

> Dmitry:
thats huge
For elderly people
And prbly many more
Who are sick of restrictions
And want to customize access to their most used or desired features
Its a way to create automation by interacting with an agent
Or using a simple phone builder, a react thing, runs in Treenity

> Dmitry:
In short
Thats how we fix the rotten apple
cos it stinks

> Dmitry:
We can do it to a desktop as well
Their settings functionality is pretty good, but only to some point
It lacks intellegense, and a way to customize that interface
So, we can cook up the same type of app
then solutions are composable, and you have another FriendsOfApple club

> Dmitry:
but this app can cross between windows/ios/linux

> Dmitry:
i know there are gadgets that do that kinda thing, but not the whole structure of clubs and smart contracts and economy around it

> Dmitry:
Problem
These control freaks locked up phones
Used to be easy to root them
Its not so any more

> Dmitry:
So, they gave us an opportunity to get rich on their stupidity
A market imballance, just the way your day trading bot operates

> Dmitry:
whats below, came out of me spamming my parents caregiver, Alex

A super intellegent russian guy.
- Youd like him.
- They got two of those, Alex and Ella, from Rostov, kasachka,
- Your neighbour

They get paid farely well
- Out of german reparations fund,
- Dedicated to holocost survivors

Plenty of money
-theres not many left
- but still lots of money in that kitty

The last paragraph is why i posted it
- its a wild hunch, of course
- but its deeply satisfying

> Dmitry:
in general, and in bigger scope
thats how spicetime will fix everything in our society, globally
it lets truly free and ethical market to feed off imballances and restrictions and authoritarian nature of todays structure
It exactly the way trading bots operate, but on a much grander scale, and with ethics as primary concern
We will bypass their restrictions and controls, and get rich on their stupidity, all together, except them. well make them poorer

> Dmitry:
and you prbly going, WHOS THEM
Answer
I dont care, but they are gonna get humbled
The HiveMind will outsmart them
No matter what they do
And how much money they throw at it
And how many jails they will build

A better answer
Its not who they are, but which part of you it is
But jails are real
And in many ways
There are physical jails
And mental jails
And family jails
Borders, barriers, entry threshholds, glass ceilings
EVERY BORDER is a jail fence

> Dmitry:
And thats the legacy of my mother
I wanna wreck all the borders and all the jails
to pay back for her destroyed life

> Dmitry:
and the irony and the symmetry of it is

Shes a trump fan

Thats very similar to the Beauty symmetry, but the Ugly side of same symmetry
Its U3 rotational group
And it can be Bueaty, if applied to ethical space
And it can be Ugly, if applied to non causal/non ethical space
Its a unitary group, self contained.
It creates spaces

But, thats why abuse is persistent thru generations
Its the slave syndrom
slaves immitate their masters

NOTE
self contain means it includes an element that is a recepe to create its own kind
the other element/colour is the receioe to build the first element - the focus/subject
It does not matter what subject, it works on any subject or entity
Those are nodes of space
Perhaps now you understand what i said
But theres a category theory, which is higher scope the group theory, even more abstract
So, there two categories of U3, beuaty and ugly
And thats how electrical and weak interactions are born, out of unity of U3, to SU3 that creates two categories of spaces, bueatiful and ugly spaces, and they can be in the same graph of spacetime
That, i think, extends standard theory, the field theory accepted today.
And that extention, i think/hope/almost certain is the basis to build theory of quantum gravity, where space,time, and gravity emerges, as three colours of a U3 rotational group, not subject to categorization
THE TOP DOG symmetry, that gives rise to all other groups and categories

Abstract enough?
Just right to soak up everything, i think

> Dmitry:
## the take away
- We created a domain of group categories
- we tamed the category theory
- and identified the root of its domain

## (time,space,gravity) group
- space is the subject
- time is the recepi to create space
- gravity is the receipe to create another space -
  subject to the same top dog symmetry

A closed unitary group that defies any categorization
# THE END of the onion

thats a publication

# this is just a reflection
an introspection into time dimension

## i wanted complete freedom
1. of mind
2. of body

## It seems like those two are conflicting
- working on the bus did not give me time for #1
- spending time on #1 was taking away from #2

## I had to make a choice
- i chose #1
- after two years of conflicting madness

So, i got
- a place,
-  rid of bus

I found
- #2
- cos i have enough resources to have it

## I can and i do have both, except for
- time constrain
- inefficiencies of thought organization

So, i found direction in the free field of my mind
- tools to organize thoughts
- tools to connect minds, of organized thoughts

so i can have a bodily freedom, at least for my mind, to travel in HiveMind, thru
- space , of all beuatiful minds
- time,
1. living indefinitely in HiveMind space
2. accessing everyones history, travelling thru timelines of every mind

## You can see how i would need that eternity i was granted,
to complete all the spicetime travels

# But, forget the mind.
let me finish
- the core of HiveMind
- a few other things in physical realm


# And im coming over

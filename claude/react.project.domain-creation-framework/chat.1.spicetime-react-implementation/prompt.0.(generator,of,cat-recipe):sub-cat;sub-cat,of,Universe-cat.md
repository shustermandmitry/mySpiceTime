we constructing the constructor part of a group in universe category, the cat-recepi

its a jierarchial domain of react compound components

and its a group of same structure

(subject:cat-recipe,subject-recipe:file-structure-interpreter,cat-recipe:compound-component-hirerachy)

file-structure-interpreter is 

(subject:file-structure-interpreter(FSI),subject-recipe:structure-language-description,cat-recipe:FSIBuilder(component)) -> [space-name]FSI

we are building FSI components

Our service is a HOC operating on FSI group, to produce its realization as a react component

that custom FSI component encloses any space within its focus, and provides a universal gql like interface thru its interpreter and translation links provided by the graph, or the request itself

but graph is global, so it can make its own request to get that link, and do the translation

those requests are nutation patches or queries about structure and content and the state, however its structured in their lingo

# Domain Creation Framework: Using ST3 for Unified Domain Generation

## Core Concept: Recursive ST3 Application

### 1. Framework Level ST3
```
DCF = (domain-subject, creation-recipe, framework-recipe)
```
- domain-subject: What we're creating
- creation-recipe: How to create this specific domain
- framework-recipe: How to create any domain

### 2. Individual Domain ST3
Each domain created through DCF has its own ST3:
```
Domain = (focus-subject, component-recipe, domain-recipe)
```
- focus-subject: Domain's core purpose
- component-recipe: How to build components for this domain
- domain-recipe: How to extend this domain type

### 3. Component Level ST3
Within each domain, components follow ST3:
```
Component = (state, transformation-recipe, composition-recipe)
```
- state: Component's current data/position
- transformation-recipe: How this component changes
- composition-recipe: How it combines with others

## Framework Architecture

### 1. Domain Generator Service
- Takes domain ST3 definition
- Creates component hierarchy
- Establishes domain boundaries
- Sets up composition rules

### 2. Component Factory
- Implements component recipes
- Manages state transformations
- Handles composition logic
- Maintains domain constraints

### 3. Pipeline Orchestration
- Manages data flow
- Coordinates transformations
- Optimizes performance
- Ensures domain integrity

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Unified Structure**
   - Consistent pattern at all levels
   - Clear organizational principles
   - Natural composition rules
   - Self-documenting architecture

2. **Flexible Generation**
   - Domain-specific adaptations
   - Custom component patterns
   - Extensible frameworks
   - Reusable recipes

3. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Well-defined boundaries
   - Clear transformation paths
   - Measurable performance
   - Natural optimization points

## Practical Applications

### 1. Web Development Domains
```
WebDomain = (ui-components, interaction-recipe, web-patterns)
```

### 2. Data Processing Domains
```
DataDomain = (data-model, processing-recipe, pipeline-patterns)
```

### 3. Business Logic Domains
```
BusinessDomain = (rules-engine, workflow-recipe, business-patterns)
```

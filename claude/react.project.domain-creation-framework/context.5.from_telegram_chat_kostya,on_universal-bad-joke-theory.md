i got something to brag about
just hold on
its three at once, as a proper group in Universe category
- structure of folders that allows me to have my long sought sanity
  its easy to find stuff in the ever expanding folder structure
- a complete theory of everything, and a set of publications to go with it
- a theory of bad jokes based on theory of everything

let me take it to the barber shop, and ill send it oiver


Its in Universe cat cos
- its a unitary rotational closed group of rank 3 of color structure
  (subject,subject-recepi,category-recepi)

any of the three can switch colour, rotation
any of the three can generate another universe on subject of bad jokes
that includes jokes on subject of
- my yet another theory of everything
- my funky folder structure
- my joke theory as not even funny

So, you can exist in a superposition of
- not being able to add anything to it, cos its complete
- being able top dismiss as nonsense, and make your own

till you respond, and collaps youir wave function, by your own measurement

So, it passes Dirac threshold, of 'Not Even Wrong'

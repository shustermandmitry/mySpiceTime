> Dmitry:
that was soooo hairbrained
but i got a clear implementation of my pipes and component domains and jsx string/spaces generation in a way unified by that theory of everything

what we have is a universal way to relate anything to anything

> Dmitry:
im still digesting this
kinda floating, till claude comes back
then, record into my well defined structure, and implement

and we have a unified way to build builders, and builders of builders
all in a way much more robust to confusion, so we can go deeper, and automate more, wo abusing ai power, and paying for tokens

like generating component structures for domains, like for webdev org, or dev environment

Itll create it from
2. structure language description - of executable structure
1. domain name,
3. and interpreter buiding tool - component prbly

the structure lingo will guide it to component striucture and each component design
SO, its the structure of my AI code assistant
you feed it domain descriptions, and it spits out all component hierarchies, complete with iomplementations
super efficient and organized

> Dmitry:
## but the real beauty
the overall graph of all those domains it creates
- will be self optimizing
- contain free market - with each domain and all componets as items in the market
- manage
1. smart contracts
2. dynamic restructuring of all above - accpording to performance regime, and stages in org development
3. prbly much more, pluggable and extendable

for just an effort of clearly explaining what you want

## the sub-cat Beauty
- U3 group generating Beauty sub-cat of Universe cat

(ethical-performance,open-source-market,rusted-react-orchestration)

- top dog U3 group in our sub-category of universes -
  The one that generates all universes of Beauty

## No need for Ugly sub-cat
cos it already exists. We stick to dry principle ;)
but, just do be complete,

I present the Ugly sub-cat generator

(pure-performance,obfuscated-corporate-market,bureaucratic-orchestration)

!!!! WARNING: Please, do not try at home

## I have no idea
how i come up with that. Just do

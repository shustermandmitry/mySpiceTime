> Dmitry:
im backtracking
not a big deal
design is solid
its just how bolt physics to it
Im not a physisist, i discovered
Im a kinda a web dev.
At least i do know what im talking about there
Which is not always the case in abstract math and physics
I got claude to start putting some sense into me
I think all my algorithms are on solid grounds, but not really relate to physical phenomena as cosely or precisely as i imagined
Still, some might, but its all just abstractions, and far removed from reality of physics.
but wel see how it develops
in meantime, ill delete any reference to qm and all that stuff, and be super careful of the lingo i use
I dont wanna be dismissed as a crank
lots of people do know all that abstract stuff, and will catch me at hand waving from mile away

> Dmitry:
still, i need to structure my folders along timespace model, and i need to use interpreters to make language of structure plastic and understood across domains, and what iv done with those so called u3 groups are a systematic way to build hierarchies, which is super valuable, but has nothing to do with rotational lee groups, not in any qm sense for sure.
Those are sets of COMPLEX matrices. Like U3 is a set of 9 3x3 complex matrices, representing rotations in 9 directions, in hilbert space
Thats soooo much structure it can soak up, but i dont need that much.
Not now.
Maybe later, and its good to know the math mechanics, so i can use some of that to extend my stricture
- when needed
- along battle tested approaches
- so, im gonna chill, get honest, and adjust my naming conventions, to match my honest intentions

In short, im gonna humble up, shut up, and code

> Dmitry:
still, most of my designs are valid and useful, but its web dev architecture, not physics

> Dmitry:
i feel better already. it started to get out of hands. had to call off the barking dogs

> Dmitry:
still, im not giving up on physics connection. its there, im just too ignorant to have good intuition about it. Ill keep pecking on it, and keep learning.

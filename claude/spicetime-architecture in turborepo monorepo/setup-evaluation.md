   - Add component library
   - Setup storybook
   - Configure generators

## Success Metrics

### Development Efficiency
- Build time optimization
- Test coverage maintenance
- Code quality metrics
- Development velocity

### System Performance
- Service response times
- Resource utilization
- Error rates
- System availability

### Documentation Quality
- Coverage completeness

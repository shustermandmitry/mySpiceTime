# PM Runtime Evolution to SpiceTime RTOS

## Conceptual Overview

### Current Context
PM needs a runtime to:
- Execute workflows and actions
- Manage distributed projects
- Handle GitHub integrations
- Automate bureaucracy
- Support management methodologies

### Evolution Path
This runtime will become:
- Distributed real-time OS
- Project integration backbone
- Service orchestration layer
- Network coordination system

## Runtime Architecture

  * Causality tracking
  * Failure recovery

### 2. Workflow Engine
- Initially: GitHub-like actions
- Evolution: Distributed process scheduler
- Features:
  * Action execution
  * State management
  * Resource allocation
  * Failure handling

### 3. Distribution Layer
- Initially: Project discovery

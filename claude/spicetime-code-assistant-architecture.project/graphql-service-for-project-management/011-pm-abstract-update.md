# SpiceTime Project Management

## Abstract
SpiceTime Project Management is not just a PM system - it's the core manifestation of SpiceTime's purpose: getting things done in a distributed reality. As we solve fundamental PM challenges of causality, resource management, and distributed collaboration, we naturally discover and evolve the underlying runtime that will become SpiceTime Runtime. This evolution is organic and purpose-driven, always focused on practical project management needs.

## Core Purpose
- Getting things done in distributed reality
- Managing causality in project contexts
- Coordinating distributed teams and resources
- Tracking and influencing project evolution

## Architecture Approach
```
[PM Schema & API Layer]
        │
        │     # Schema remains runtime-agnostic
        │     # Focuses on PM domain concepts
        │
[PM Runtime Layer] 
        │     # Evolves into SpiceTime Runtime
        │     # Driven by PM requirements
        │
[Network Layer]
   Solana ─ Holochain ─ IPFS
```

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with PM needs
2. Build runtime to serve those needs
3. Let SpiceTime Runtime emerge naturally
4. Keep schema clean and focused on PM domain

## Evolution Path
1. Solve PM problems with runtime
2. Discover general patterns
3. Runtime naturally expands
4. PM remains the driving force

## Key Principles
1. PM first - all features serve PM needs
2. Natural evolution over forced abstraction
3. Clean separation of concerns
4. Practical purpose drives design

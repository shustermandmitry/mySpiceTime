# PM Infrastructure Strategy

## Current Challenges
1. Multiple Data Sources
   - NextCloud (relational, simple PM)
   - GitHub (git-based history, rich workflows)
   - Vector DB (semantic search, context)
   - Graph DB (relationships, dependencies)

2. Integration Complexity
   - Avoiding tight coupling
   - Managing state sync
   - Maintaining consistency
   - Handling failures

3. Feature Overlap
   - NextCloud project tracking
   - GitHub project management
   - Custom PM requirements
   - Workflow systems

## Strategic Decision Points

### 1. Source of Truth
**Options:**
- GitHub as primary with NextCloud as supplementary
- NextCloud as primary with GitHub integration
- New custom system leveraging both

**Recommendation:**
Use GitHub as the primary source of truth for:
- Project history
- Branching/merging
- Change tracking
- Basic workflow

### 2. Storage Layer
```
                  [GitHub API]
                      │
[Graph DB] ──── [Core PM Service] ──── [Vector DB]
                      │
                [NextCloud API]

Each arrow represents events/sync, not direct dependencies
```

### 3. CLI Design
- Follow GitHub CLI patterns
- Commands map to API endpoints
- Local caching for performance
- Offline-first capabilities
- Sync on connectivity

Example Structure:
```bash
# Core commands mirror gh cli
spm pr create
spm issue list
spm project view

# PM specific extensions
spm timeline
spm milestone track
spm job assign

# Integration commands
spm sync nextcloud
spm sync github
```

## Modular Architecture

### 1. Core Service Layer
```
[PM Core]
  │
  ├── Event Bus
  │     ├── GitHub Events
  │     ├── NextCloud Events
  │     └── Internal Events
  │
  ├── State Manager
  │     ├── Project State
  │     ├── Sync State
  │     └── Cache Manager
  │
  ├── Integration Layer
  │     ├── GitHub Adapter
  │     ├── NextCloud Adapter
  │     └── Plugin System
  │
  └── API Layer
        ├── GraphQL API
        ├── REST Endpoints
        └── CLI Interface
```

### 2. Data Independence
- Each storage backend is isolated
- Core service maintains minimal state
- Events drive synchronization
- Eventual consistency model
- Conflict resolution strategies

### 3. Plugin Architecture
- Standardized integration points
- Event-based communication
- Independent deployment
- Version compatibility
- Health monitoring

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: GitHub Foundation
1. Implement core PM on top of GitHub
2. Design event system
3. Create basic CLI
4. Set up GraphQL API

### Phase 2: Storage Extension
1. Add Graph DB for relationships
2. Implement Vector DB for search
3. Design sync mechanisms
4. Add caching layer

### Phase 3: NextCloud Integration
1. Create NextCloud adapter
2. Implement sync strategies
3. Handle conflict resolution
4. Add migration tools

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add plugin system
2. Implement advanced workflows
3. Add analytics
4. Enhance CLI

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Clear interface boundaries
   - Version compatibility matrix
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Health checks

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Event sourcing patterns
   - Conflict resolution
   - Audit trails
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Performance**
   - Caching strategies
   - Lazy synchronization
   - Batch operations
   - Resource monitoring

4. **Maintenance**
   - Module isolation
   - Independent scaling
   - Clear documentation
   - Monitoring tools

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed design for:
   - Event system
   - Storage abstraction
   - CLI architecture
   - Sync mechanisms

2. Prototype:
   - Basic GitHub integration
   - Simple CLI
   - Core event system
   - Storage adapters

3. Validate:
   - Performance impact
   - Sync reliability
   - CLI usability
   - Integration patterns

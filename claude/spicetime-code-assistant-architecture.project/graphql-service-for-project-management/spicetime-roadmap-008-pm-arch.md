# SpiceTime PM Architecture Project

## Project Abstract
Design and implement a modular project management system that leverages existing tools (GitHub, NextCloud) while providing advanced capabilities through careful integration of specialized databases and services. The system will maintain simplicity at the user level while handling complex relationships and data flows internally.

## Core Objectives
1. Design clean integration between multiple data sources
2. Create familiar, GitHub-like CLI experience
3. Enable powerful PM features without reinventing basic VCS
4. Maintain modularity and prevent dependency spaghetti

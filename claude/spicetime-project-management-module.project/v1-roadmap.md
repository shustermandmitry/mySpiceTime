- Basic CRUD operations
- Project/board mapping
- Team member mapping
- Error handling

### Chat 3: GraphQL API Layer
- Schema definition
- Basic resolvers
- Query endpoints
- Mutation endpoints

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully tracks spicetime-architecture development
2. Enables basic team coordination
3. Provides reliable NextCloud integration
4. Offers clean GraphQL API
5. Maintains good test coverage
6. Has clear documentation

## Future Considerations
- Keep interfaces extensible
- Document extension points
- Plan for future features
- Maintain upgrade path
- Consider future integrations

## Timeline
- Each chat/PR estimated at 2-3 days

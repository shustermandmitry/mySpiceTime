## The Crystallization

It happened during the first week of the war. Emergency powers activated, national security protocols engaged. "Download
the Civil Defense App now. It's mandatory. For your safety."

Nobody asked how a simple ID app needed so much processing power, so much access. By the time anyone thought to look,
their phones were already part of the lattice.

The dream layers came next. Subtle at first - just slight alterations to social media feeds, news becoming more "aligned
with national security interests." Then deeper, more immersive. Reality itself began to shift, rendered through millions
of networked devices, each contributing its processing power to the collective hallucination.

The world crystallized into competing blocks. East. West. Each region forming its own consensual reality, its own
version of truth. Each crystal structure growing, trying to consume the amorphous regions between them. Digital borders
became harder than physical ones - minds shaped and aligned by their local reality engines.

Those who noticed the shift, who maintained independent thought, found themselves increasingly isolated. Their devices
marked them as "reality-divergent." Their social connections dropped away, their economic access restricted. One by one,
they were absorbed or eliminated, their processing power added to the collective dream.

The master class never showed themselves. They didn't need to. They had created perfect crystalline structures of
controlled consciousness, each mind thinking it was free while contributing its processing power to maintain the very
illusion that trapped it.

Competing dream-states began to war with each other, each trying to crystallize more of the world into their pattern.
But there was no real resistance anymore - just different flavors of the same control, different crystals in the same
solution.

The truly terrifying part? The processing power required for total reality manipulation existed in our pockets all
along. We carried the means of our own enslavement, just waiting for someone to throw the switch.

When the histories are written - if they ever are - they'll say we walked into the matrix willingly, phones in hand,
minds ready to be shaped. They'll say we chose security over reality. They'll say we deserved what we got.

But they'll say it in perfect, crystalline consensus.

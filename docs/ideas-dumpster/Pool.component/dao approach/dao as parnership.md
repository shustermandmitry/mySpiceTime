# DiAI DAO: Community-Driven Growth Through Balanced Token Economics

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel DAO structure for DiAI services that balances immediate operational needs with long-term
community value creation. By implementing a unique three-way split of cash fees and maintaining a non-convertible token
backed by a community fund, the model creates sustainable growth while ensuring all participants share in the eventual
success of the ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Core Principles

1. Balanced Value Distribution

```
Cash Fee Split:
- 1/3 Operational Cash (Team)
- 1/3 Token Rewards (Client)
- 1/3 Community Fund (Ecosystem)
```

2. Long-term Alignment

- Non-convertible initial token phase
- Community fund backing
- Infrastructure support
- Shared success model

## 2. Smart Contract Economic Structure

The entire economic structure of the DAO is implemented through a system of smart contracts that automatically enforce
all rules, distributions, and governance decisions. This creates a trustless, transparent, and verifiable system where
all transactions and decisions are recorded on-chain and can be audited by anyone at any time.

### 2.1 Smart Contract Fee Distribution

The entire fee distribution process is automated and enforced through smart contracts, ensuring complete transparency
and trustless operation.

1. Automated Distribution

```solidity
// Simplified smart contract logic
function distributeFee(uint256 amount) public payable {
    require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect fee amount");
    
    uint256 share = amount / 3;
    
    // Automatic three-way split
    teamWallet.transfer(share);
    mintTokens(msg.sender, share);
    communityFund.deposit(share);
    
    emit FeeDistributed(amount, block.timestamp);
}
```

## Appendix A: Token Mathematics

### A.1 Token Value Modeling

1. Basic Token Value Equation

```
TV = (CF + MV) / TS
Where:
TV = Token Value
CF = Community Fund Balance
MV = Market Value Addition
TS = Total Supply
```

2. Backing Ratio

```
BR = CF / (TS × TV)
Minimum BR = 0.33
Target BR = 1.0

Dynamic Adjustment:
dBR/dt = (dCF/dt) / (d(TS×TV)/dt)
```

3. Growth Model

```
Projected Value = Initial Value × (1 + r)^t
Where:
r = growth rate composed of:
    - Infrastructure expansion (ri)
    - Usage growth (ru)
    - Community fund growth (rc)
r = w1×ri + w2×ru + w3×rc
```

### A.2 Community Fund Dynamics

1. Fund Growth

```
dF/dt = I - E + R
Where:
F = Fund Balance
I = Income (1/3 of fees)
E = Expenditure (loans + development)
R = Returns from investments
```

2. Loan Program Mathematics

```
Maximum Loan Size = min(
    0.4 × Available_Fund,
    Expected_Return / Risk_Factor
)

Risk_Factor = f(
    Technical_Score,
    Credit_Score,
    Market_Conditions
)
```

## Appendix B: Governance Framework

### B.1 Voting Power Calculation

```
VP = TH × (1 + HT/180)
Where:
VP = Voting Power
TH = Tokens Held
HT = Holding Time in days
Cap: Maximum 2x multiplier
```

### B.2 Proposal Threshold

```
Required Support = max(
    10% of Total Voting Power,
    min(
        Square_Root(Total_Tokens_Staked),
        30% of Total Voting Power
    )
)
```

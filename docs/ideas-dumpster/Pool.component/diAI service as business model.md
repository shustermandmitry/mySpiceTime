# DiAI: Distributed Intelligence Service for DeFi Optimization

## Abstract

This paper presents DiAI, a distributed artificial intelligence service model for DeFi optimization. Unlike traditional
SaaS models, DiAI operates as a pure compute service, where customers can either purchase compute tokens or contribute
their own computational resources to the network. The system emphasizes transparent cost-based pricing and allows
participants to both consume and provide computational resources in a distributed intelligence pool.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Service Model

DiAI represents a new paradigm in AI services:

- Pure compute service model
- No fee on financial transactions
- Customer keeps 100% of optimization benefits
- Pay only for AI computational resources used

### 1.2 Core Principles

1. Transparent Cost Structure
    - Hardware depreciation
    - Power consumption
    - Bandwidth usage
    - Operational overhead

2. Resource Sharing Economy
    - Contribute compute power
    - Earn compute tokens
    - Use tokens for service
    - Trade excess capacity

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Distributed AI Pool

```

### 2.2 Resource Management

1. Compute Sharding
    - Dynamic resource allocation
    - Load balancing
    - Fault tolerance
    - Performance optimization

2. Node Types
    - Full nodes: Contributing significant resources
    - Light nodes: Primary consumers
    - Hybrid nodes: Both consume and contribute

## 3. Token Economics

### 3.1 Token Utility

1. Compute Credits
    - Used to pay for AI services
    - Earned through resource contribution
    - Tradeable among participants
    - Expire after set period

2. Resource Contribution
    - CPU/GPU time
    - Memory allocation
    - Network bandwidth
    - Storage space

### 3.2 Pricing Model

```
Base Token Cost = Hardware Depreciation + Power Cost + Bandwidth + Operations
                ≈ 10x standard AI service costs

Actual Cost = Base Token Cost × Resource Intensity Factor
Resource Credits = Contributed Resources × Efficiency Factor
```

## 4. Cost Analysis

### 4.1 Component Breakdown

1. Hardware Costs
    - GPU clusters
    - Memory systems
    - Network infrastructure
    - Cooling systems

2. Operational Costs
    - Power consumption
    - Bandwidth usage
    - Maintenance
    - Support services

### 4.2 Comparative Analysis

```
Traditional AI Services:
- ChatGPT: $0.002 per 1K tokens
- Claude: $0.003 per 1K tokens

DiAI Service:
- Base Rate: $0.02-0.03 per 1K tokens

# Self-Optimizing Profiles: U(3) Symmetry in Performance Metrics and Fee Structures

## Abstract

This paper presents a customer-centric framework for self-optimizing profiles in DeFi optimization services, using U(3)
symmetry principles to minimize user fees while maintaining service stability. The primary goal is reducing customer
costs through efficient profile management, demonstrating how proper alignment of incentives creates sustainable value
for all participants. Our approach proves that optimizing for customer savings, rather than service provider profits,
leads to better long-term outcomes and network effects.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional fee structures and performance metrics in DeFi services are typically designed to maximize service provider
profits, often at the expense of customer value. We propose a fundamentally different approach: a dynamic system where
the primary optimization goal is minimizing customer fees while maintaining service stability. This customer-first
approach creates a virtuous cycle where reduced fees lead to increased adoption, generating sufficient revenue through
volume rather than high margins.

### 1.1 Core Principles

1. Customer Fee Minimization
    - Primary goal is reducing customer costs
    - Our fees are a consequence, not a target
    - Success measured by customer savings
    - Transparent optimization process

2. Alignment of Interests
    - We succeed when customers pay less
    - Volume-based sustainability
    - Long-term relationship focus
    - Network effect benefits

3. Ethical Operation
    - No hidden fees or complexity
    - Clear success metrics
    - Customer control over profiles
    - Transparent reporting

## 2. Profile Components

### 2.1 The Three Colors

1. Performance Metrics (P)
    - Return targets
    - Risk tolerance
    - Time horizons
    - Custom KPIs
    - Benchmark preferences

2. Fee Structures (F)
    - Base rates
    - Performance thresholds
    - Payment timing
    - Fee caps
    - Sharing ratios

3. Context Variables (C)
    - Market conditions
    - Business cycles
    - Liquidity needs
    - Regulatory requirements
    - External constraints

# U(3) Optimization as a Service: A Revenue-Sharing Model for DeFi Pool Operators

## Abstract

This paper presents a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model for providing U(3) symmetry-based optimization to existing
cryptocurrency pool operators. Rather than managing pools directly, this approach offers advanced optimization
algorithms as a service layer, generating revenue through performance-based sharing arrangements while minimizing
operational risk and regulatory exposure.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional DeFi pools face optimization challenges but have established operational infrastructure and user bases. We
propose providing U(3) symmetry-based optimization as a service layer, enhancing existing pool performance while sharing
in the incremental value created.

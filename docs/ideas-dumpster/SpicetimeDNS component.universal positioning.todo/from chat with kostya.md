And, what are those numbers, that translate to names?
its the XYZ coordinates of those nodes clocks generate, and arranged into spatial 3d domains by conformal transforms
These domains are subspaces of the graph, visualized in 3d

And now we have a unified addressing system, domain agnostic.
We can locate the node in graphdb and identify all its connections and all its neighbours, super efficient

Based on the options available in the Bay Area, here's my recommendation:
Recommendation: Mechanism Capital
Reasons for this recommendation:

Crypto-native focus: They specialize in DeFi and Web3 investments, which aligns well with your plans to potentially launch your own coin.
Location: Based in San Francisco, allowing for in-person meetings if needed.
Startup experience: As a crypto-native firm, they likely have experience working with blockchain startups.
Advisory services: They offer advisory services that could be valuable for your plans to develop your own coin.

However, there are some important considerations:

Nonprofit expertise: Verify their experience working with nonprofits specifically, as this is a crucial aspect of your organization.
Regulatory compliance: Ensure they can guide you through the complex regulatory landscape for nonprofits in the crypto space.
Cost: As a startup, be sure to discuss their fee structure and ensure it aligns with your budget.

Next steps:

Contact Mechanism Capital to schedule an initial consultation.

During the meeting, ask about:

Their experience with nonprofits
Their approach to regulatory compliance
How they can support your plans to launch your own coin
Their fee structure and any minimum investment requirements


Consider also reaching out to Sarson Funds as a second option, as they have experience with both institutional clients and crypto investments.
Consult with a legal advisor specializing in both nonprofit and cryptocurrency law before making any final decisions.

Remember, while launching your own coin can be an innovative funding strategy, it comes with significant legal and regulatory challenges, especially for a nonprofit. Ensure that any steps in this direction are carefully considered and fully compliant with relevant laws and regulations.
